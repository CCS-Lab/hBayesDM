data_columns:
  subjID: A unique identifier for each subject in the data-set.
  level1_choice: "Choice made for Level (Stage) 1 (1: stimulus 1, 2: stimulus 2)."
  level2_choice:
    "Choice made for Level (Stage) 2 (1: stimulus 3, 2: stimulus 4, 3:
    stimulus 5, 4: stimulus 6).\n        Note that, in our notation, choosing stimulus
    1 in Level 1 leads to stimulus 3 & 4 in Level 2 with a common (0.7 by default)
    transition. Similarly, choosing stimulus 2 in Level 1 leads to stimulus 5 & 6
    in Level 2 with a common (0.7 by default) transition. To change this default transition
    probability, set the function argument `trans_prob` to your preferred value."
  reward: Reward after Level 2 (0 or 1).
