notes:
  - Note that this implementation is NOT the full Drift Diffusion Model as described
    in Ratcliff (1978). This implementation estimates the drift rate, boundary separation,
    starting point, and non-decision time; but not the between- and within-trial variances
    in these parameters.
  - Code for this model is based on codes/comments by Guido Biele, Joseph Burling, Andrew
    Ellis, and potential others @ Stan mailing.

data_columns:
  subjID: A unique identifier for each subject in the data-set.
  choice:
    Choice made for the current trial, coded as 1/2 to indicate lower/upper
    boundary or left/right choices (e.g., 1 1 1 2 1 2).
  RT:
    Choice reaction time for the current trial, in **seconds** (e.g., 0.435 0.383
    0.314 0.309, etc.).
