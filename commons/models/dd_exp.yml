data_columns:
  subjID: A unique identifier for each subject in the data-set.
  delay_later:
    An integer representing the delayed days for the later option (e.g.
    1, 6, 28).
  amount_later:
    A floating point number representing the amount for the later option
    (e.g. 10.5, 13.4, 30.9).
  delay_sooner:
    An integer representing the delayed days for the sooner option (e.g.
    0).
  amount_sooner:
    A floating point number representing the amount for the sooner option
    (e.g. 10).
  choice:
    If amount_later was selected, choice == 1; else if amount_sooner was selected,
