\details{
This section describes some of the function arguments in greater detail.

\strong{data} should be assigned a character value specifying the full path and name of the file, including the file extension 
(e.g. ".txt"), that contains the behavioral data of all subjects of interest for the current analysis. 
The file should be a text (.txt) file whose rows represent trial-by-trial observations and columns 
represent variables. For the Delay Discounting Task, there should be six columns of data 
with the labels "subjID", "delay_later", "amount_later", "delay_sooner", "amount_sooner", and "choice". 
It is not necessary for the columns to be in this particular order, however it is necessary that they be labelled 
correctly and contain the information below:
\describe{
 \item{\code{"subjID"}}{A unique identifier for each subject within data-set to be analyzed.}
 \item{\code{"delay_later"}}{An integer representing the delayed days for the later option within the given trial. (e.g., 1 6 15 28 85 170).}
 \item{\code{"amount_later"}}{A floating number representing the amount for the later option within the given trial. (e.g., 10.5 38.3 13.4 31.4 30.9, etc.).}
 \item{\code{"delay_sooner"}}{An integer representing the delayed days for the sooner option (e.g., 0 0 0 0).}
 \item{\code{"amount_sooner"}}{A floating number representing the amount for the sooner option (e.g., 10 10 10 10).}
 \item{\code{"choice"}}{An integer value representing the chosen option within the given trial (e.g., 0=instant amount, 1=delayed amount )}
}
\strong{*}Note: The data.txt file may contain other columns of data (e.g. "Reaction_Time", "trial_number", etc.), but only the data with the column
names listed above will be used for analysis/modeling. As long as the columns above are present and labelled correctly,
there is no need to remove other miscellaneous data columns.
 
\strong{nwarmup} is a numerical value that specifies how many MCMC samples should not be stored upon the 
beginning of each chain. For those familiar with Bayesian methods, this value is equivalent to a burn-in sample. 
Due to the nature of MCMC sampling, initial values (where the sampling chain begins) can have a heavy influence 
on the generated posterior distributions. The \code{nwarmup} argument can be set to a high number in order to curb the 
effects that initial values have on the resulting posteriors.  

\strong{nchain} is a numerical value that specifies how many chains (i.e. independent sampling sequences) should be
used to draw samples from the posterior distribution. Since the posteriors are generated from a sampling 
process, it is good practice to run multiple chains to ensure that a representative posterior is attained. When
sampling is completed, the multiple chains may be checked for convergence with the \code{plot(myModel, type = "trace")}
command. The chains should resemble a "furry caterpillar".

\strong{nthin} is a numerical value that specifies the "skipping" behavior of the MCMC samples being chosen 
to generate the posterior distributions. By default, \code{nthin} is equal to 1, hence every sample is used to 
generate the posterior. 

\strong{Contol Parameters:} adapt_delta, stepsize, and max_treedepth are advanced options that give the user more control 
over Stan's MCMC sampler. The Stan creators recommend that only advanced users change the default values, as alterations
can profoundly change the sampler's behavior. Refer to Hoffman & Gelman (2014, Journal of Machine Learning Research) for 
more information on the functioning of the sampler control parameters. One can also refer to section 58.2 of the  
\href{http://mc-stan.org/documentation/}{Stan User's Manual} for a less technical description of these arguments.

# Run the model and store results in "output"
output <- dd_exp(data = "example", niter = 2000, nwarmup = 1000, nchain = 3, ncore = 3)

# Visually check convergence of the sampling chains (should like like 'hairy caterpillars')
plot(output, type = 'trace')

# Check Rhat values (all Rhat values should be less than or equal to 1.1)
rhat(output)

# Plot the posterior distributions of the hyper-parameters (distributions should be unimodal)
plot(output)

# Show the WAIC and LOOIC model fit estimates
