\details{
This section describes some of the function arguments in greater detail.

\strong{data} should be assigned a character value specifying the full path and name of the file, including the file extension
(e.g. ".txt"), that contains the behavioral data of all subjects of interest for the current analysis.
The file should be a \strong{tab-delimited} text (.txt) file whose rows represent trial-by-trial observations and columns
represent variables. For the Choice under Risk and Ambiguity Task, there should be five columns of data with the labels
"subjID", "prob", "ambig", "reward_var", "reward_fix" and "choice". It is not necessary for the columns to be in this
particular order, however it is necessary that they be labelled correctly and contain the information below:
\describe{
 \item{\code{"subjID"}}{A unique identifier for each subject within data-set to be analyzed.}
 \item{\code{"prob"}}{Objective probability of a variable lottery.}
 \item{\code{"ambig"}}{Ambiguity levels of variable lotteries. For a risky lottery, \code{"ambig"} equals 0, and more than zero for an ambiguous lottery}
 \item{\code{"reward_var"}}{Amounts of reward values in variable lotteries. \code{"reward_var"} is assumed to be greater than zero.}
 \item{\code{"reward_fix"}}{Amounts of reward values in fixed lotteries. \code{"reward_fix"} is assumed to be greater than zero.}
 \item{\code{"choice"}}{If the variable lottery was taken, \code{"choice"} equals 1, otherwise 0.}
}
\strong{*}Note: The data.txt file may contain other columns of data (e.g. "Reaction_Time", "trial_number", etc.), but only the data with the column
names listed above will be used for analysis/modeling. As long as the columns above are present and labelled correctly,
there is no need to remove other miscellaneous data columns.

\strong{nwarmup} is a numerical value that specifies how many MCMC samples should not be stored upon the
beginning of each chain. For those familiar with Bayesian methods, this value is equivalent to a burn-in sample.
Due to the nature of MCMC sampling, initial values (where the sampling chain begins) can have a heavy influence
on the generated posterior distributions. The \code{nwarmup} argument can be set to a high number in order to curb the
effects that initial values have on the resulting posteriors.

\strong{nchain} is a numerical value that specifies how many chains (i.e. independent sampling sequences) should be
used to draw samples from the posterior distribution. Since the posteriors are generated from a sampling
process, it is good practice to run multiple chains to ensure that a representative posterior is attained. When
sampling is completed, the multiple chains may be checked for convergence with the \code{plot(myModel, type = "trace")}
command. The chains should resemble a "furry caterpillar".

\strong{nthin} is a numerical value that specifies the "skipping" behavior of the MCMC samples being chosen
to generate the posterior distributions. By default, \code{nthin} is equal to 1, hence every sample is used to
generate the posterior.

\strong{Contol Parameters:} adapt_delta, stepsize, and max_treedepth are advanced options that give the user more control
over Stan's MCMC sampler. The Stan creators recommend that only advanced users change the default values, as alterations
can profoundly change the sampler's behavior. Refer to Hoffman & Gelman (2014, Journal of Machine Learning Research) for
more information on the functioning of the sampler control parameters. One can also refer to section 58.2 of the
\href{http://mc-stan.org/documentation/}{Stan User's Manual} for a less technical description of these arguments.

\dontrun{
# Run the model and store results in "output"
output <- cra_exp(data = "example", niter = 2000, nwarmup = 1000, nchain = 4, ncore = 4)

# Visually check convergence of the sampling chains (should like like 'hairy caterpillars')
plot(output, type = 'trace')

# Check Rhat values (all Rhat values should be less than or equal to 1.1)
rhat(output)

# Plot the posterior distributions of the hyper-parameters (distributions should be unimodal)
plot(output)

# Show the WAIC and LOOIC model fit estimates
