\details{
This section describes some of the function arguments in greater detail.

\strong{data} should be assigned a character value specifying the full path and name (including
  extension information, e.g. ".txt") of the file that contains the behavioral data-set of all
  subjects of interest for the current analysis. The file should be a \strong{tab-delimited} text
  file, whose rows represent trial-by-trial observations and columns represent variables.\cr
For the Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task, there should be 4 columns of data with the
  labels "subjID", "block", "choice", "outcome". It is not necessary for the columns to be in this particular order,
  however it is necessary that they be labeled correctly and contain the information below:
\describe{
  \item{"subjID"}{A unique identifier for each subject in the data-set.}
  \item{"block"}{A unique identifier for each of the multiple blocks within each subject.}
  \item{"choice"}{Integer value representing the option chosen on that trial: 1 or 2.}
  \item{"outcome"}{Integer value representing the outcome of that trial (where reward == 1, and loss == -1).}
  
  
  
  
  
}
\strong{*}Note: The file may contain other columns of data (e.g. "ReactionTime", "trial_number",
  etc.), but only the data within the column names listed above will be used during the modeling.
  As long as the necessary columns mentioned above are present and labeled correctly, there is no
  need to remove other miscellaneous data columns.

\strong{nwarmup} is a numerical value that specifies how many MCMC samples should not be stored
  upon the beginning of each chain. For those familiar with Bayesian methods, this is equivalent
  to burn-in samples. Due to the nature of the MCMC algorithm, initial values (i.e. where the
  sampling chains begin) can have a heavy influence on the generated posterior distributions. The
  \code{nwarmup} argument can be set to a high number in order to curb the effects that initial
  values have on the resulting posteriors.

\strong{nchain} is a numerical value that specifies how many chains (i.e. independent sampling
  sequences) should be used to draw samples from the posterior distribution. Since the posteriors
  are generated from a sampling process, it is good practice to run multiple chains to ensure
  that a reasonably representative posterior is attained. When the sampling is complete, it is
  possible to check the multiple chains for convergence by running the following line of code:
  \code{plot(output, type = "trace")}. The trace-plot should resemble a "furry caterpillar".

\strong{nthin} is a numerical value that specifies the "skipping" behavior of the MCMC sampler,
  using only every \code{i == nthin} samples to generate posterior distributions. By default,
  \code{nthin} is equal to 1, meaning that every sample is used to generate the posterior.

\strong{Control Parameters:} \code{adapt_delta}, \code{stepsize}, and \code{max_treedepth} are
  advanced options that give the user more control over Stan's MCMC sampler. It is recommended
  that only advanced users change the default values, as alterations can profoundly change the
  sampler's behavior. Refer to 'The No-U-Turn Sampler: Adaptively Setting Path Lengths in
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Hoffman & Gelman, 2014, Journal of Machine Learning Research)' for
  more information on the sampler control parameters. One can also refer to 'Section 34.2. HMC
  Algorithm Parameters' of the \href{http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/}{Stan User's Guide
  and Reference Manual}, or to the help page for \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for a less technical
  description of these arguments.
