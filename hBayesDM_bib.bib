	Abstract = {A formal modeling approach was used to characterize decision-making processes in bipolar disorder. Decision making was examined in 28 bipolar patients (14 acute and 14 remitted) and 25 controls using the Iowa Gambling Task (Bechara et al., 1994), a decision-making task used for assessing cognitive impulsivity. To disentangle motivational and cognitive aspects of decision-making processes, we applied a formal cognitive model to the performance on the Iowa Gambling Task. The model has three parameters: The relative impact of rewards and punishments on evaluations, the impact of recent and past payoffs, and the degree of choice consistency. The results indicated that acute bipolar patients were characterized by low choice consistency, or a tendency to make erratic choices. Low choice consistency improved the prediction of acute bipolar disorder beyond that provided by cognitive functioning and self-report measures of personality and temperament.},

	Abstract = {This study examined the utility of Cloninger's tridimensional personality
	theory (1986, 1987a) in predicting preferred substance of abuse and
	self-reported motivations for use among a sample of 200 adolescent
	substance abusers and 200 matched community control adolescents.
	Two primary hypotheses were tested: (1) Cloninger's type II profile
	is more strongly associated with stimulant use, and his type I profile
	is more strongly associated with substances having sedative-hypnotic
	effects; and 2) type II individuals will report motivations for use
	that focus primarily on obtaining positive rewards, whereas type
	I individuals will report motivations primarily concerning negative
	reinforcement or the avoidance of problems and negative life experiences.
	Our results did not show strong associations between Cloninger's
	Harm Avoidance and Reward Dependence dimensions and preferred substance
	or motivations for use. However, in partial support of the hypotheses
	examined here, we did find that individuals low in novelty seeking
	(NS) tended to prefer alcohol and marijuana, whereas those high in
	NS endorsed a wider range of preferred substances. High NS was associated
	with significantly greater stimulant use and motivations focused
	on obtaining positive rewards, whereas low NS was associated with
	greater sedative use and motivations related to avoiding negative
	emotions or negative life experiences.},

	Abstract = {Research and clinical expertise indicates that impulsivity is an underlying
	feature of pathological gambling. This study examined the extent
	to which impulsive behavior, defined by the rate of discounting delayed
	monetary rewards, varies with pathological gambling severity, assessed
	by the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS). Sixty-two pathological
	gamblers completed a delay discounting task, the SOGS, the Eysenck
	impulsivity scale, the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and questions
	about gambling and substance use at intake to outpatient treatment
	for pathological gambling. In the delay discounting task, participants
	chose between a large delayed reward (US $1000) and smaller more
	immediate rewards (US $1-$999) across a range of delays (6h to 25
	years). The rate at which the delayed reward was discounted (k value)
	was derived for each participant and linear regression was used to
	identify the variables that predicted k values. Age, gender, years
	of education, substance abuse treatment history, and cigarette smoking
	history failed to significantly predict k values. Scores on the Eysenck
	impulsivity scale and the SOGS both accounted for a significant proportion
	of the variance in k values. The predictive value of the SOGS was
	1.4 times that of the Eysenck scale. These results indicate that
	of the measures tested, gambling severity was the best single predictor
	of impulsive behavior in a delay discounting task in this sample

@article{Bando1996,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although several techniques for the treatment of long-segment
	stenosis of the trachea have been reported, including slide tracheoplasty,
	rib grafting, and use of a pericardial patch, the optimal repair
	remains controversial because of a lack of midterm to long-term follow-up
	data. METHODS: To assess the intermediate and long-term outcomes
	of patients having repair with anterior pericardial tracheoplasty,
	we reviewed case histories of 12 patients (1984 to present). The
	median age was 6.7 months (range, 1 to 98 months), and the median
	weight was 6.0 kg (range, 0.97 to 42 kg). All patients underwent
	anterior pericardial tracheoplasty through a median sternotomy during
	partial normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. An average of 13 tracheal
	rings (range, five to 23) were divided anteriorly, and a patch of
	fresh autologous pericardium was used to enlarge the trachea by 1.5
	times the predicted diameter for patient age and weight. RESULTS:
	There was one hospital death, and all but 2 patients are long-term
	survivors. All but 1 current survivor remain asymptomatic, with no
	bronchoscopic evidence of airway obstruction or granulation on the
	pericardial patch. All survivors examined have normal tracheal growth
	and development, with a median follow-up of 5.5 years (range, 1 to
	11 years). CONCLUSIONS: Anterior pericardial tracheoplasty for congenital
	tracheal stenosis provides excellent results at intermediate to long-term
	follow-up.},

@article{Bell2007,
	Abstract = {Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance from the central nervous system
	(CNS) maintains its low levels in brain. In Alzheimer's disease,
	Abeta accumulates in brain possibly because of its faulty CNS clearance
	and a deficient efflux across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). By using
	human-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we measured a
	rapid 30 mins efflux at the BBB and transport via the interstitial
	fluid (ISF) bulk flow of human-unlabeled Abeta and of Abeta transport
	proteins, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apoJ in mice. We show (i) Abeta40
	is cleared rapidly across the BBB via low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
	protein (LRP)1 at a rate of 0.21 pmol/min g ISF or 6-fold faster
	than via the ISF flow; (ii) Abeta42 is removed across the BBB at
	a rate 1.9-fold slower compared with Abeta40; (iii) apoE, lipid-poor
	isoform 3, is cleared slowly via the ISF flow and across the BBB
	(0.03-0.04 pmol/min g ISF), and after lipidation its transport at
	the BBB becomes barely detectable within 30 mins; (iv) apoJ is eliminated
	rapidly across the BBB (0.16 pmol/min g ISF) via LRP2. Clearance
	rates of unlabeled and corresponding 125I-labeled Abeta and apolipoproteins
	were almost identical, but could not be measured at low physiologic
	levels by mass spectrometry. Amyloid beta-peptide 40 binding to apoE3
	reduced its efflux rate at the BBB by 5.7-fold, whereas Abeta42 binding
	to apoJ enhanced Abeta42 BBB clearance rate by 83\%. Thus, Abeta,
	apoE, and apoJ are cleared from brain by different transport pathways,
	and apoE and apoJ may critically modify Abeta clearance at the BBB.},

	to follow, much less interpret. We have created a publicly available,
	continuously updated database that comprehensively catalogs all genetic
	association studies in the field of Alzheimer disease (http://www.alzgene.org).
	We performed systematic meta-analyses for each polymorphism with
	available genotype data in at least three case-control samples. In
	addition to identifying the epsilon4 allele of APOE and related effects,
	we pinpointed over a dozen potential Alzheimer disease susceptibility
	genes (ACE, CHRNB2, CST3, ESR1, GAPDHS, IDE, MTHFR, NCSTN, PRNP,
	PSEN1, TF, TFAM and TNF) with statistically significant allelic summary
	odds ratios (ranging from 1.11-1.38 for risk alleles and 0.92-0.67
	for protective alleles). Our database provides a powerful tool for
	deciphering the genetics of Alzheimer disease, and it serves as a
	potential model for tracking the most viable gene candidates in other

	delay discounting studies in light of this new perspective. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH:
	To accomplish this we (1) introduce this new conceptual model, (2)
	briefly review executive function, including evidence for executive
	dysfunction among the addicted, (3) describe the unique relationship
	of temporal discounting to the new model and executive dysfunction,
	and (4) reinterpret the discounting literature in light of this new
	conceptual model. FINDINGS: Addicted individuals discount the future
	more than controls. This is consistent with greater relative activation
	of the impulsive system and decreased relative activation of the
	executive system. It also supports the new conceptual model of addiction.
	RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The new model provides a model for understanding
	the observations from the broader area of research in temporal discounting.
	ORIGINALITY/VALUE OF CHAPTER: Given the view of executive function
	as important for the cross-temporal organization of behavior, we

	Abstract = {Recent work on cognitive control has suggested a variety of performance
	monitoring functions of the anterior cingulate cortex such as errors,
	conflict, error likelihood, and others. Given the variety of monitoring
	effects, a corresponding variety of control effects on behavior might
	be expected. This paper explores whether conflict and error likelihood
	produce distinct cognitive control effects on behavior, as measured
	by response time. A Change signal task (Brown & Braver, Science 307:1118-1121,
	2005) was modified to include conditions of likely errors due to
	tardy as well as premature responses in conditions with and without
	conflict. The results discriminate between competing hypotheses of
	independent versus interacting conflict and error likelihood control
	effects. Specifically, the results suggest that the likelihood of
	premature versus tardy response errors can lead to multiple distinct
	control effects, which are independent of cognitive control effects
	driven by response conflict. As a whole, the results point to the
	existence of multiple distinct cognitive control mechanisms and challenge
	existing models of cognitive control that incorporate only a single
	control signal.},

@article{Brown2009,
	Abstract = {The error likelihood computational model of anterior cingulate cortex
	(ACC) (Brown, J.W., Braver, T.S., 2005. Learned predictions of error
	likelihood in the anterior cingulate cortex. Science 307: 1118-1121)
	has successfully predicted error likelihood effects, risk prediction
	effects, and how individual differences in conflict and error likelihood
	effects vary with trait differences in risk aversion. The same computational
	model now makes a further prediction that apparent conflict effects
	in ACC may result in part from an increasing number of simultaneously
	active responses, regardless of whether or not the cued responses
	are mutually incompatible. In Experiment 1, the model prediction
	was tested with a modification of the Eriksen flanker task, in which
	some task conditions require two otherwise mutually incompatible
	responses to be generated simultaneously. In that case, the two response
	processes are no longer in conflict with each other. The results
	showed small but significant medial PFC effects in the incongruent
	vs. congruent contrast, despite the absence of response conflict,
	consistent with model predictions. This is the multiple response
	effect. Nonetheless, actual response conflict led to greater ACC
	activation, suggesting that conflict effects are specific to particular
	task contexts. In Experiment 2, results from a change signal task
	suggested that the context dependence of conflict signals does not
	depend on error likelihood effects. Instead, inputs to ACC may reflect
	complex and task specific representations of motor acts, such as
	bimanual responses. Overall, the results suggest the existence of
	a richer set of motor signals monitored by medial PFC and are consistent
	with distinct effects of multiple responses, conflict, and error
	likelihood in medial PFC.},

	Abstract = {Insectivorous bat embryos (Tadarida and Myotis) ranging from 6- to
	16-mm C-R length were examined for the presence of the nervus terminalis.
	These embryos have no vomeronasal nerve with which the nervus terminalis
	could be confused. The nerve and associated ganglion cells first
	appear in the 7-mm embryo. As the embryo ages, a gradual increase
	in nerve size and ganglion cell numbers occurs. In the 13-mm embryo,
	nerve size and ganglion cell numbers are reduced, and in older embryos
	both nerve and cells are absent, as in the adult. The ganglion cells
	arise as clusters from the nasal septal epithelium. The largest number
	of cell clusters occurs in the 10.5-mm embryo. Their number then
	decreases and none are present in embryos of 13-mm and longer. These
	cells migrate centrally along the course of the nerve which accompanies
	the olfactory nerve from the nasal cavity roof to a level just caudal
	to the olfactory bulb, where the nervus terminalis turns dorsalward
	along the medial telencephalic wall surface. Except in the youngest
	and oldest embryos the nervus terminalis, where present, divides
	into two or three branches to pierce the hemispheric wall, one usually
	entering the region of the nucleus olfactorious anterior, and the
	other(s), the region of the medial septal nucleus. In some cases,
	several ganglion cells are present along the intrahemispheric course
	of the nerve fibers. All ganglion cells resemble those in various
	sensory ganglia, and so, are probably also sensory neurons.},

	Abstract = {The error likelihood effect in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has
	recently been shown to be a special case of an even more general
	risk prediction effect, which signals both the likelihood of an error
	and the potential severity of its consequences. Surprisingly, these
	error likelihood and anticipated consequence effects are strikingly
	absent in risk-taking individuals. Conversely, conflict effects in
	ACC were found to be stronger in these same individuals. Here we
	show that the error likelihood computational model can account for
	individual differences in error likelihood, predicted error consequence,
	and conflict effects in ACC with no changes from the published version
	of the model. In particular, the model accounts for the counterintuitive
	inverse relationship between conflict and error likelihood effects
	as a function of the ACC learning rate in response to errors. As
	the learning rate increases, ACC learns more effectively from mistakes,
	which increases risk prediction effects at the expense of conflict
	effects. Thus, the model predicts that individuals with faster error-based
	learning in ACC will be more risk-averse and shows greater ACC error
	likelihood effects but smaller ACC conflict effects. Furthermore,
	the model suggests that apparent response conflict effects in ACC
	may actually consist of two related effects: increased error likelihood
	and a greater number of simultaneously cued responses, whether or
	not the responses are mutually incompatible. The results clarify
	the basic computational mechanisms of learned risk aversion and may
	have broad implications for predicting and managing risky behavior
	in healthy and clinical populations.},

	Abstract = {The recently proposed error-likelihood hypothesis suggests that anterior
	cingulate cortex (ACC) and surrounding areas will become active in
	proportion to the perceived likelihood of an error. The hypothesis
	was originally derived from a computational model prediction. The
	same computational model now makes a further prediction that ACC
	will be sensitive not only to predicted error likelihood, but also
	to the predicted magnitude of the consequences, should an error occur.
	The product of error likelihood and predicted error consequence magnitude
	collectively defines the general "expected risk" of a given behavior
	in a manner analogous but orthogonal to subjective expected utility
	theory. New fMRI results from an incentivechange signal task now
	replicate the error-likelihood effect, validate the further predictions
	of the computational model, and suggest why some segments of the
	population may fail to show an error-likelihood effect. In particular,
	error-likelihood effects and expected risk effects in general indicate
	greater sensitivity to earlier predictors of errors and are seen
	in risk-averse but not risk-tolerant individuals. Taken together,
	the results are consistent with an expected risk model of ACC and

	recruiting brain activity to avoid risk.},

	Abstract = {The ideal operation for infants with coarctation of the aorta remains
	controversial. Subclavian flap aortoplasty is the most popular technique
	for this age group. The 5 to 20\% recurrence rate is attributed to
	regrowth of the coarctation web or inadequate length of the subclavian
	flap, particularly when the aortic isthmus is long and narrow. Severe
	arm ischemia following subclavian flap aortoplasty, although rare,
	is a disturbing complication. The purpose of this study is to report
	the results with a new technique we call isthmus flap aortoplasty
	for coarctation of a long segment of the aorta in infants. This technique
	avoids the limitations of subclavian flap aortoplasty. A short segment
	of aorta, including the ductal entrance and coarctation web, was
	resected in 4 infants (mean age, 35.5 days) with long-segment coarctation.
	The posterior wall of the long isthmus was opened longitudinally
	to the level of the transverse aortic arch. The descending aorta
	was mobilized and advanced to the level of the aortic arch where
	the posterior half was sutured. The anterior flap of attached isthmus
	was then sewn into a longitudinal incision made in the anterior wall
	of the descending aorta. All infants survived this procedure and
	had no gradient at completion of the repair. The mean transconduit
	gradient at rest was zero and rose to 7.0 +/- 0.93 mm Hg after angiography
	at a mean follow-up of 42 months. Aortograms demonstrated that the

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Truncus arteriosus (TA) continues to be associated with
	significant morbidity and mortality, but there have been clinically
	significant improvements with early repair. METHODS: Sixty patients
	underwent physiological correction of TA between November 1978 and
	January 2000. The average age was 76 days (range, 3 days--20 months).
	Associated cardiac anomalies were frequently encountered, the most
	common being severe truncal valve regurgitation (n=7), interrupted
	aortic arch (n=6), coronary artery anomalies (n=6), non-confluent
	pulmonary arteries (n=4), and total anomalous pulmonary venous return
	(n=1). Truncal valve replacement was performed initially or subsequently
	in seven patients with severe regurgitation (mechanical prostheses
	in six patients and a cryopreserved aortic homograft in one patient).
	Right ventricle--pulmonary artery continuity was established with
	an aortic (n=16) or pulmonary homograft (n=32) in 48 patients, a
	Dacron polyester porcine valved conduit in five, a non-valved polytetrafluoroethylene
	(PTFE) tube in three, direct anastomosis to the right ventricle with
	anterior patch arterioplasty in three, and a bovine jugular venous
	valve conduit in one patient. RESULTS: There were ten hospital deaths
	(17\%; 70\% confidence limit, 7--25\%). Multivariate and univariate
	analyses demonstrated a relationship between hospital mortality and
	associated cardiac anomalies. In the 43 patients without these associated
	cardiac anomalies, the early survival was 91\% (group I). In the
	17 patients with one or more of these risk factors, the survival
	was 71\% (group II, P=0.002). There was one late death. Twenty-three
	patients (46\%) required reoperation for right ventricular outflow
	tract (RVOT) obstruction at a mean follow-up time of 59.1 months.
	In 23 patients, the RVOT reconstruction was performed with a PTFE
	monocusp, and six patients had of a variety of replacement conduits
	inserted. Postoperatively, there were 34 (68\%) patients in New York
	Heart Association functional class I and 16 (32\%) in class II. Twenty-eight
	surviving patients are reported as doing well without any medication.
	The freedom of reoperation in the 39 hospital survivors (group I)
	without risk factors was 64\% at 7 years; and 36\% at 10 years in
	the 11 patients (group II) surviving with risk factors. CONCLUSIONS:
	Associated cardiac anomalies were risk factors for death after the
	repair of TA. In the absence of these associated lesions, TA can
	be repaired with an excellent surgical outcome in the neonatal and
	early infancy period.},

	Abstract = {Two sets of experiments were performed to characterize the role of
	the Pre-Optic Area of the Anterior Hypothalamus (POAH) in the decrease
	in set point and hypothermia that follows severe hemorrhage. In the
	first set, lidocaine or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was
	microinjected into the POAH of rats at the time of hemorrhage. Lidocaine
	microinjection attenuated the hemorrhagic hypothermia by approximately
	50\%. The mean drop in core temperature (Tc) following hemorrhage
	was 1.5 degrees C with ACSF microinjection (N = 6), 0.70 degrees
	C (N = 6) with lidocaine, and 1.77 degrees C (N = 6) after sham microinjection.
	This partial attenuation of the hemorrhagic hypothermic response
	indicates that an intact POAH is necessary for at least some of the
	hypothermia following hemorrhage. In the second experimental set,
	hypothalamic tissue temperature (Thyp) was modulated in an attempt
	to alter the hemorrhagic hypothermic response. Bilateral closed-ended
	cannulas were inserted into the POAH. One cannula consisted of a
	water-perfused thermode to change local tissue temperature. The other
	housed a thermocouple to measure local temperature. The effectiveness
	of the thermode was first confirmed in conscious rats, evidenced
	by an inverse deflection in Tc upon Thyp modulation. Then, the POAH
	region was either heated, cooled, or sham perfused following hemorrhage.
	The mean drop in Tc following hemorrhage was 2.16 degrees C (N =
	5) with hypothalamic heating, 1.35 degrees C (N = 5) with cooling,
	and 1.44 degrees C (N = 5) following the sham perfusion control.
	Heating of the POAH significantly exacerbated the hemorrhagic hypothermic
	response. These data further suggest that the POAH is at least partially
	responsible for mediating hemorrhagic hypothermia.},

@article{Chakroun2004,
	Abstract = {SUMMARY: The International Consortium of Psychiatric Epidemiology
	has confirmed the high comorbidity in community-drawn samples between
	substance use disorders and anxiety or depression. In the same way,
	associations between substance use and specific personality traits
	(such as novelty seeking, harm avoidance or antisocial personality)
	have also been extensively documented. Self-medication and social
	deviance are among the most commonly evoked explanatory models for
	these forms of comorbidity, and are based on findings that affective
	disorders and specific personality traits often precede the onset
	of substance use disorders. The self-medication model postulates
	that an individual chooses a specific substance according to its
	psychopharmacologic action on the given psychological state of the
	person. By contrast, the social deviance model posits that this form
	of comorbidity is due to the fact that persons consuming certain
	substances may have affective or personality characteristics that
	are more severe or more deviant than non-consumers (or than consumers
	of socially well-accepted substances). In this way, the individual
	does not use a particular substance to assuage pre-existing disorders
	but, due to a more deviant personality, is less influenced by social
	norms and may more easily turn to using illicit substances or to
	polyconsumption. However, a major limitation of the current scientific
	literature concerning tests of these models is that previous investigations
	have been based in overwhelming majority on clinical populations.
	The examination only of clinical samples renders difficult the identification
	of causal (or primary) risk factors for the emergence of substance
	use disorders from the potential consequences of substance use itself.
	The goal of the current study was therefore to simultaneously compare
	both models of association using a non clinical population of substance
	users. In addition to selecting subjects based on use (rather than
	abuse or dependence), multiple comparisons were corrected with a
	Bonferroni adjustment. METHOD: A two-phase sampling plan was used
	with post-stratification on substances use. In the first stage, an
	initial sample of 685 students was pre-selected based on responses
	to a battery of self-questionnaires, including information concerning
	recent consumption of substances (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, heroin,
	acid, solvents, and so on), anxiety levels measured by the State
	and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, Spielberger, 1983) and depression
	levels evaluated by the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression
	Scale (CES-D, Radloff, 1977). Based on responses to these questionnaires,
	98 subjects were selected in the second phase to compose four groups
	of substance users: non consumers (those who did not use any substance
	during the last month); consumers of alcohol only, consumers of cannabis
	(with or without alcohol) and consumers of other illicit substances
	(with or without cannabis or alcohol). These subjects were then invited
	to participate in a brief laboratory-based meeting where they completed
	the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI, Cloninger, 1992), which
	assessed different personality characteristics such as novelty seeking
	(NS), harm avoidance (HA) or antisocial personality disorder (APD).
	ANALYSES: The hypotheses concerning self-medication were tested by
	multiple logistic regression by comparing each group of substance
	consumption to the non-consumer group relative to levels of anxiety,
	depression and scores of novelty seeking and harm avoidance. The
	social deviance model was tested by ANOVAs using contrasts which
	allowed for a test of a linear tendency across the four groups of
	consumption relative to each of the personality traits (novelty seeking,
	harm avoidance and antisocial personality). RESULTS: Results of multiple
	logistic regressions showed no difference between non-consumers and
	any group of consumers with regard to anxiety, depression and harm
	avoidance. However, consumers of other illicit substances significantly
	differed from non-consumers for novelty seeking trait (qOR=8.4; p<0.05).
	Results of the ANOVA also showed no differences between the four
	groups with regard to scores of harm avoidance and level of antisocial
	personality but again a comparison of novelty seeking scores was
	significant, F(94)=6.46, p<0.05. Moreover, the contrast method demonstrated
	that novelty seeking scores increased linearly and significantly
	(p<0.001) from the group of non-consumers to the group of the consumers
	of the most deviant substances. CONCLUSION: The results obtained
	in this non-clinical sample are in favor of social deviance model
	which posits that the personality trait of novelty seeking is associated
	to the consumption of the most illicit and deviant substances (such
	as heroin or cocaine). On the other hand, no support was found for
	the hypothesis of self-medication which assumes that specific substances
	should be particularly associated with specific psychological characteristics
	or vulnerabilities.},

	in adolescence and young adulthood. The authors describe basic and
	clinical data supporting adolescent neurodevelopment as a biologically
	critical period of greater vulnerability for experimentation with
	substances and acquisition of substance use disorders. METHOD: The
	authors reviewed recent literature regarding neurocircuitry underlying
	motivation, impulsivity, and addiction, with a focus on studies investigating
	adolescent neurodevelopment. RESULTS: Adolescent neurodevelopment
	occurs in brain regions associated with motivation, impulsivity,
	and addiction. Adolescent impulsivity and/or novelty seeking as a
	transitional trait behavior can be explained in part by maturational
	changes in frontal cortical and subcortical monoaminergic systems.
	These developmental processes may advantageously promote learning
	drives for adaptation to adult roles but may also confer greater
	vulnerability to the addictive actions of drugs. CONCLUSIONS: An
	exploration of developmental changes in neurocircuitry involved in
	impulse control has significant implications for understanding adolescent
	behavior, addiction vulnerability, and the prevention of addiction
	in adolescence and adulthood.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mania has received little attention from a contemporary
	neuropsychological perspective despite its clear resemblance to the
	disinhibition syndrome sometimes seen after frontal brain injury,
	particularly injury to the inferior aspect of the prefrontal cortex.
	The purpose of this investigation was to describe the neuropsychological
	profile of severe acute mania by using a range of tasks selected
	primarily for the detection of localized neural disruption within
	the prefrontal cortex. METHOD: Fifteen acutely manic inpatients were
	compared with 30 nonpsychiatric subjects on tasks from the Cambridge
	Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (Tower of London, spatial
	working memory, intradimensional-extradimensional attentional shift,
	and rapid visual information processing tasks) and on the Iowa Gambling
	Task, Stroop Color and Word Test, a verbal fluency task, and the
	California Verbal Learning Test. RESULTS: Discriminant function analysis
	identified deficits in sustained attention (on the rapid visual information
	processing task) and verbal learning (on the California Verbal Learning
	Test) as the best indicators of manic performance, rather than deficits
	on any of the tests of executive functioning. The model correctly
	classified 91\% of subjects overall and 87\% of manic subjects. Manic
	patients did not resemble patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex
	damage in their performance on the Iowa Gambling Task. CONCLUSIONS:
	Acute mania is characterized by core deficits in verbal memory and
	sustained attention against a background of milder impairments in
	functions that are traditional measures of prefrontal cortex integrity
	(attentional set shifting, planning, working memory). The data do
	not implicate ventral prefrontal cortex disruption as a locus of
	pathology in acute mania. Verbal memory and sustained attention deficits
	may relate differentially to the state and trait characteristics
	of bipolar disorder.},

@article{Comings2000,
	Abstract = {The dopaminergic and opioidergic reward pathways of the brain are
	critical for survival since they provide the pleasure drives for
	eating, love and reproduction; these are called 'natural rewards'
	and involve the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and
	frontal lobes. However, the same release of dopamine and production
	of sensations of pleasure can be produced by 'unnatural rewards'
	such as alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, nicotine, marijuana,
	and other drugs, and by compulsive activities such as gambling, eating,
	and sex, and by risk taking behaviors. Since only a minority of individuals
	become addicted to these compounds or behaviors, it is reasonable
	to ask what factors distinguish those who do become addicted from
	those who do not. It has usually been assumed that these behaviors
	are entirely voluntary and that environmental factors play the major
	role; however, since all of these behaviors have a significant genetic
	component, the presence of one or more variant genes presumably act
	as risk factors for these behaviors. Since the primary neurotransmitter
	of the reward pathway is dopamine, genes for dopamine synthesis,
	degradation, receptors, and transporters are reasonable candidates.
	However, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, opioid, and cannabinoid
	neurons all modify dopamine metabolism and dopamine neurons. We have
	proposed that defects in various combinations of the genes for these
	neurotransmitters result in a Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) and
	that such individuals are at risk for abuse of the unnatural rewards.
	Because of its importance, the gene for the [figure: see text] dopamine
	D2 receptor was a major candidate gene. Studies in the past decade
	have shown that in various subject groups the Taq I A1 allele of
	the DRD2 gene is associated with alcoholism, drug abuse, smoking,
	obesity, compulsive gambling, and several personality traits. A range
	of other dopamine, opioid, cannabinoid, norepinephrine, and related
	genes have since been added to the list. Like other behavioral disorders,
	these are polygenically inherited and each gene accounts for only
	a small per cent of the variance. Techniques such as the Multivariate
	Analysis of Associations, which simultaneously examine the contribution
	of multiple genes, hold promise for understanding the genetic make
	up of polygenic disorders.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite effective pharmacological treatments for bipolar
	disorder, we still lack a comprehensive pathophysiological model
	of the illness. Recent neurobiological research has implicated a
	number of key brain regions and neuronal components in the behavioural
	and cognitive manifestations of bipolar disorder. Dopamine has previously
	been investigated in some depth in bipolar disorder, but of late
	has not been a primary focus of attention. This article examines
	the role of dopamine in bipolar disorder, incorporating recent advances
	into established models where possible. METHODS: A critical evaluation
	of the literature was undertaken, including a review of behavioural,
	neurochemical, receptor, and imaging studies, as well as genetic
	studies focusing on dopamine receptors and related metabolic pathways.
	In addition, pharmacologic manipulation of the central dopaminergic
	pathways and comparisons with other disease states such as schizophrenia
	were considered, principally as a means of exploring the hypothesised
	models. RESULTS: Multiple lines of evidence, including data from
	pharmacological interventions and structural and functional magnetic
	resonance imaging studies, suggest that the dopaminergic system may
	play a central role in bipolar disorder. CONCLUSION: Future research
	into the pathophysiological mechanisms of bipolar disorder and the
	development of new treatments for bipolar disorder should focus on
	the dopaminergic system.},

	Abstract = {We used functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging to measure brain
	activity during delay between reward-related decisions and their
	outcomes, and the modulation of this delay activity by uncertainty
	and arousal. Feedback, indicating financial gain or loss, was given
	following a fixed delay. Anticipatory arousal was indexed by galvanic
	skin conductance. Delay-period activity was associated with bilateral
	activation in orbital and medial prefrontal, temporal, and right
	parietal cortices. During delay, activity in anterior cingulate and
	orbitofrontal cortices was modulated by outcome uncertainty, whereas
	anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, and parietal cortices
	activity was modulated by degree of anticipatory arousal. A distinct
	region of anterior cingulate was commonly activated by both uncertainty
	and arousal. Our findings highlight distinct contributions of cognitive
	uncertainty and autonomic arousal to anticipatory neural activity
	in prefrontal cortex.},

	be differentiated from late-onset alcoholics (LOAs) by more severe
	substance-related problems and higher levels of impulsivity and aggression.
	DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: A cross-sectional patient survey with a
	community comparison group. The European Addiction Severity Index
	was used to assess substance-related problems and the Barratt Impulsiveness
	Scale, the Dutch version of the Zuckermann Sensation Seeking Scale
	and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory were used to assess impulsive
	and aggressive traits. Impulsive decision making was assessed using
	a delay discounting task (DDT) with hypothetical monetary rewards.
	PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were EOAs (n = 42) and LOAs
	(n = 46) recruited from an addiction treatment centre and an unmatched,
	non-substance-abusing comparison group (n = 54). Findings The EOAs
	had higher levels of impulsive decision making than both the LOAs
	and the comparison group. The EOAs had higher scores than the LOAs
	on measures of impulsiveness, aggressiveness and the severity of
	substance-related problems. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence
	that EOAs are more impulsive and aggressive than LOAs. Further identification
	of alcoholism subtypes based on dimensions of impulsivity should
	be considered in the light of their relationship with pharmacological
	and behavioural treatment interventions.},

	and aggressive traits. Impulsive decision making was assessed using
	a delay discounting task (DDT) with hypothetical monetary rewards.
	PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were EOAs (n = 42) and LOAs
	(n = 46) recruited from an addiction treatment centre and an unmatched,
	non-substance-abusing comparison group (n = 54). Findings The EOAs
	had higher levels of impulsive decision making than both the LOAs
	and the comparison group. The EOAs had higher scores than the LOAs
	on measures of impulsiveness, aggressiveness and the severity of
	substance-related problems. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence
	that EOAs are more impulsive and aggressive than LOAs. Further identification
	of alcoholism subtypes based on dimensions of impulsivity should
	be considered in the light of their relationship with pharmacological
	and behavioural treatment interventions.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orbitofrontal cortex dysfunctions have been frequently
	documented in people with substance use disorders. The exact role
	of this cortical region, however, remains unspecified. AIMS: To assess
	the functionality of the orbitofrontal cortex in people with substance
	use disorders. METHOD: Reports of studies using behavioural decision-making
	tasks and/or neuroimaging techniques to investigate orbitofrontal
	cortex functioning in cases of substance misuse were reviewed. Studies
	focusing exclusively on tobacco-smoking and gambling were excluded.
	RESULTS: Fifty-two research articles were evaluated. Most studies
	showed significant deficits in decision-making in people with substance
	use disorders. A consistent finding in the neuroimaging studies was
	hypoactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex after detoxification. The
	association between hyperactivity of this region and craving or cue
	reactivity was not consistent across studies. CONCLUSIONS: The orbitofrontal
	cortex has an important role in addictive behaviours. Further studies
	are needed to elucidate the underlying neuronal substrates of cue
	reactivity, craving and decision-making, and the implications for
	treatment and relapse prevention.},

@article{Dunnett1985b,
	Abstract = {To provide a more specific test of memory impairments following lesions
	to central cholinergic systems, rats were trained on an operant delayed
	matching task. Ibotenic acid lesions of the nucleus basalis produced
	a disruption of performance at all delay intervals (a parallel downward
	shift in the delay-performance curve). By contrast, fimbria-fornix
	transections had no effects at short delays, but produced a progressively
	greater impairment as the delays lengthened (an increased downward
	slope of the delay-performance curve). Scopolamine produced a dose-dependent
	disruption of performance, apparent at the shortest delays but greater
	at longer delays, that was similar to the two lesion deficits combined,
	whereas physostigmine induced a mild but significant enhancement
	of performance. The results support the hypothesis that disruption
	of hippocampal circuitries, including cholinergic afferents via the
	fimbria-fornix, produces short-term or working memory impairments,
	whereas disruption of the cortical cholinergic system implicates
	more stable long-term aspects of task performance. Peripherally administered
	cholinergic drugs produce both types of effect and thus may influence
	both systems.},

	Abstract = {We describe intracranial local field potentials (LFP) recorded in
	the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of macaque monkeys performing
	a saccade countermanding task. The most prominent feature at approximately
	70\% of sites was greater negative polarity after errors than after
	rewarded correct trials. This negative polarity was also evoked in
	unrewarded correct trials. The LFP evoked by the visual target was
	much less polarized, and the weak presaccadic modulation was insufficient
	to control the initiation of saccades. When saccades were cancelled,
	LFP modulation decreased slightly with the magnitude of response
	conflict that corresponds to the coactivation of gaze-shifting and
	-holding neurons estimated from the probability of canceling. However,
	response time adjustments on subsequent trials were not correlated
	with LFP polarity on individual trials. The results provide clear
	evidence that error- and feedback-related, but not conflict-related,
	signals are carried by the LFP in the macaque ACC. Finding performance
	monitoring field potentials in the ACC of macaque monkeys establishes
	a bridge between event-related potential and functional brain-imaging
	studies in humans and neurophysiology studies in non-human primates.},

@article{Ersche2005,
	Abstract = {RATIONALE: There is converging evidence for impairments in decision-making
	in chronic substance users. In the light of findings that substance
	abuse is associated with disruptions of the functioning of the striato-thalamo-orbitofrontal
	circuits, it has been suggested that decision-making impairments
	are linked to frontal lobe dysfunction. We sought to investigate
	this possibility using functional neuroimaging. METHODS: Decision-making
	was investigated using the Cambridge Risk Task during H2(15)O PET
	scans. A specific feature of the Risk Task is the decisional conflict
	between an unlikely high reward option and a likely low reward option.
	Four groups, each consisting of 15 participants, were compared: chronic
	amphetamine users, chronic opiate users, ex-drug users who had been
	long-term amphetamine/opiate users but are abstinent from all drugs
	of abuse for at least 1 year and healthy matched controls without
	a drug-taking history. RESULTS: During decision-making, control participants
	showed relatively greater activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal
	cortex, whereas participants engaged in current or previous drug
	use showed relatively greater activation in the left orbitofrontal
	cortex. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a disturbance in the mediation
	by the prefrontal cortex of a risky decision-making task associated
	with amphetamine and opiate abuse. Moreover, this disturbance was
	observed in a group of former drug users who had been abstinent for
	at least 1 year.},

@article{Forbes2007,
	Abstract = {Individual differences in traits such as impulsivity involve high
	reward sensitivity and are associated with risk for substance use
	disorders. The ventral striatum (VS) has been widely implicated in
	reward processing, and individual differences in its function are
	linked to these disorders. Dopamine (DA) plays a critical role in
	reward processing and is a potent neuromodulator of VS reactivity.
	Moreover, altered DA signaling has been associated with normal and
	pathological reward-related behaviors. Functional polymorphisms in
	DA-related genes represent an important source of variability in
	DA function that may subsequently impact VS reactivity and associated
	reward-related behaviors. Using an imaging genetics approach, we
	examined the modulatory effects of common, putatively functional
	DA-related polymorphisms on reward-related VS reactivity associated
	with self-reported impulsivity. Genetic variants associated with
	relatively increased striatal DA release (DRD2 -141C deletion) and
	availability (DAT1 9-repeat), as well as diminished inhibitory postsynaptic
	DA effects (DRD2 -141C deletion and DRD4 7-repeat), predicted 9-12\%
	of the interindividual variability in reward-related VS reactivity.
	In contrast, genetic variation directly affecting DA signaling only
	in the prefrontal cortex (COMT Val158Met) was not associated with
	variability in VS reactivity. Our results highlight an important
	role for genetic polymorphisms affecting striatal DA neurotransmission
	in mediating interindividual differences in reward-related VS reactivity.
	They further suggest that altered VS reactivity may represent a key
	neurobiological pathway through which these polymorphisms contribute
	to variability in behavioral impulsivity and related risk for substance
	use disorders.},

	Abstract = {The massive health problem associated with cigarette smoking is exacerbated
	by the addictive properties of tobacco smoke and the limited success
	of current approaches to cessation of smoking. Yet little is known
	about the neuropharmacological actions of cigarette smoke that contribute
	to smoking behaviour, or why smoking is so prevalent in psychiatric
	disorders and is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's
	disease. Here we report that brains of living smokers show a 40\%
	decrease in the level of monoamine oxidase B (MAO B; EC 1.4.3.4)
	relative to non-smokers or former smokers. MAO B is involved in the
	breakdown of dopamine, a neurotransmitter implicated in reinforcing
	and motivating behaviours as well as movement. MAO B inhibition is
	therefore associated with enhanced activity of dopamine, as well
	as with decreased production of hydrogen peroxide, a source of reactive
	oxygen species. We propose that reduction of MAO B activity may synergize
	with nicotine to produce the diverse behavioural and epidemiological
	effects of smoking.},

@article{Golde2006a,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in industrialized
	nations. If more effective therapies are not developed that either
	prevent AD or block progression of the disease in its very early
	stages, the economic and societal cost of caring for AD patients
	will be devastating. Only two types of drugs are currently approved
	for the treatment of AD: inhibitors of acetyl cholinesterase, which
	symptomatically enhance cognitive state to some degree but are not
	disease modifying; and the adamantane derivative, memantine. Memantine
	preferentially blocks excessive NMDA receptor activity without disrupting
	normal receptor activity and is thought to be a neuroprotective agent
	that blocks excitotoxicty. Memantine therefore may have a potentially
	disease modifying effect in multiple neurodegenerative conditions.
	An improved understanding of the pathogeneses of AD has now led to
	the identification of numerous therapeutic targets designed to alter
	amyloid beta protein (Abeta) or tau accumulation. Therapies that
	alter Abeta and tau through these various targets are likely to have
	significant disease modifying effects. Many of these targets have
	been validated in proof of concept studies in preclinical animal
	models, and some potentially disease modifying therapies targeting
	Abeta or tau are being tested in the clinic. This review will highlight
	both the promise of and the obstacles to developing such disease
	modifying AD therapies.},

@article{Gomez2008,
	Abstract = {This article investigates how the perspective from which we see an
	object affects memory. Object identification can be affected by the
	orientation of the object. Palmer, Rosch, and Chase (1981) coined
	the term canonical to describe perspectives in which identification
	performance is best. We present two experiments that tested the effects
	of object perspective on memory. Our results revealed a double dissociation
	between task (recognition and recall) and type of object perspective.
	In recognition, items studied in the noncanonical viewpoint produced
	higher proportions of "old" responses than did items studied in the
	canonical viewpoint, whereas new objects presented from a noncanonical
	viewpoint produced fewer "old" responses than did new objects presented
	from the canonical viewpoint. In free recall, conversely, objects
	studied from the noncanonical viewpoint produced lower recall rates
	than did objects studied from the canonical viewpoint. These results,
	which reveal a pattern similar to word frequency effects, support
	the psychological reality of canonical viewpoints and the frequency-of-exposure-based
	accounts of canonical viewpoint effects.},

	Abstract = {The neurotransmitter dopamine is integrally involved in the rewarding
	effects of drugs, and it has also been thought to mediate impulsive
	behaviors in animal models. Most of the studies of drug effects on
	impulsive behaviors in humans have involved drugs with complex actions
	on different transmitter systems and different receptor subtypes.
	The present study was designed to characterize the effect of single
	doses of pramipexole, a D2/D3 agonist, on measures of cognitive and
	impulsive behavior, as well as on mood in healthy volunteers. Healthy
	men and women (N = 10) received placebo and 2 doses of pramipexole,
	0.25 and 0.50 mg, in a within-subject, double-blinded study. Outcome
	measures included changes in cognitive performance, assessed by the
	Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics, several behavioral
	measures related to impulsive behavior, including the Balloon Analogue
	Risk Task, Delay Discounting Task, Go/No-Go Task, Card Perseveration
	Task, and subjective ratings of mood assessed by Addiction Research
	Center Inventory, Profile of Mood States, and Drug Effects Questionnaire.
	Pramipexole decreased positive ratings of mood (euphoria, intellectual
	efficiency, and energy) and increased both subjectively reported
	sedation and behavioral sedation indicated by impaired cognitive
	performance on several measures of the Automated Neuropsychological
	Assessment Metrics. Single low to medium doses of this drug did not
	produce a decrease in impulsive responding on behavioral measures
	included in this study. The sedative-like effects observed in this
	study may reflect presynaptic actions of the drug. Higher doses with
	postsynaptic actions may be needed to produce either behavioral or

@article{Hanlon1990,
	Abstract = {In a number of studies that have examined the gestural disturbance
	in aphasia and the utility of gestural interventions in aphasia therapy,
	a variable degree of facilitation of verbalization during gestural
	activity has been reported. The present study examined the effect
	of different unilateral gestural movements on simultaneous oral-verbal
	expression, specifically naming to confrontation. It was hypothesized
	that activation of the phylogenetically older proximal motor system
	of the hemiplegic right arm in the execution of a communicative but
	nonrepresentational pointing gesture would have a facilitatory effect
	on naming ability. Twenty-four aphasic patients, representing five
	aphasic subtypes, including Broca's, Transcortical Motor, Anomic,
	Global, and Wernicke's aphasics were assessed under three gesture/naming
	conditions. The findings indicated that gestures produced through
	activation of the proximal (shoulder) musculature of the right paralytic
	limb differentially facilitated naming performance in the nonfluent
	subgroup, but not in the Wernicke's aphasics. These findings may
	be explained on the view that functional activation of the archaic
	proximal motor system of the hemiplegic limb, in the execution of
	a communicative gesture, permits access to preliminary stages in
	the formative process of the anterior action microgeny, which ultimately
	emerges in vocal articulation.},

	Abstract = {Congenital tracheal stenosis may be a life-threatening anomaly not
	relieved by airway intubation. Over the past 7 years, anterior pericardial
	tracheoplasty has been used at our institution for treatment of congenital
	long-segment tracheal stenosis in infants with impeding airway obstruction.
	Case histories of eight patients undergoing nine anterior pericardial
	tracheoplasties have been reviewed to assess this technique. Of these
	patients, six have required preoperative tracheal intubation before
	repair to maintain ventilation. The surgical technique of anterior
	pericardial tracheoplasty includes a median sternotomy approach with
	partial normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. An anterior tracheotomy
	through all hypoplastic rings allows enlargement with autologous
	pericardium to 1.5 times the predicted normal diameter. After insertion,
	the pericardium and hypoplastic tracheal cartilages are suspended
	to surrounding mediastinal structures, which prevents airway collapse.
	Seven of eight infants have survived without tracheoplasty dehiscence
	or wound infections. Five were ultimately extubated and are currently
	free of symptoms from 6 months to 5 years after anterior pericardial
	tracheoplasty. The other two survivors had residual stenosis as a
	result of complications of prior tracheostomy. One of these patients
	has undergone a successful second anterior pericardial tracheoplasty
	and is currently extubated and well. The other is palliated at 6
	months with a tracheostomy awaiting a second anterior pericardial
	tracheoplasty. Our review of anterior pericardial tracheoplasty has
	demonstrated the safety, utility, and at least medium-term benefit
	of this procedure in infants of any age and weight.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA)-dependent individuals prefer smaller
	immediate over larger delayed rewards in delay discounting (DD) tasks.
	Human and animal data implicate ventral (amygdala, ventral striatum,
	ventrolateral prefrontal cortex insula) and dorsal (dorsolateral
	prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and posterior
	parietal cortex) systems in DD decisions. The ventral system is hypothesized
	to respond to the salience and immediacy of rewards while the dorsal
	system is implicated in the process of comparison and choice. METHODS:
	We used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to probe the neural
	correlates of DD in 19 recently abstinent MA-dependent patients and
	17 age- and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: Hard DD choices were
	associated with greatest activation in bilateral middle cingulate,
	posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and the right rostral insula. Control
	subjects showed more activation than MA patients bilaterally in the
	precuneus and in the right caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex
	(ACC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Magnitude of discounting
	was correlated with activity in the amygdala, DLPFC, posterior cingulate
	cortex and PPC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings were consistent with a
	model wherein dorsal cognitive systems modulate the neural response
	of ventral regions. Patients addicted to MA, who strongly prefer
	smaller immediate over larger delayed rewards, activate the dorsal
	cognitive control system in order to overcome their preference. Activation
	of the amygdala during choice of delayed rewards was associated with
	a greater degree of discounting, suggesting that heavily discounting
	MA-dependent individuals may be more responsive to the negative salience
	of delayed rewards than controls.},

	Abstract = {A superior-anterior mediastinal tumor was excised from a 50-year-old
	man. The 207-g mass was encapsulated and multilobulated. It contained
	adipose tissue and abnormal thymic tissue. In some areas the thymic
	tissue was characterized by cords and nests of epithelial cells lying
	within either the adipose tissue or a myxoid matrix. Other areas
	were characterized by cortical thymic tissue with increased numbers
	of epithelial cells. Foci of normal medullary tissue were present.
	The prominent epithelial cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin
	and nonimmunoreactive for vimentin, S-100, chromogranin, and parathyroid
	hormone. Flow cytometry showed that the lymphocyte populations were
	consistent with a late cortical thymic phenotype. The tumor was diploid.
	By electron microscopy, the prominent epithelial cells had desmosomes
	and a few tonofilaments. The cytoplasm contained additional organelles
	including mitochondria, polyribosomes, and occasional lysosomes.
	Nuclei were oval and had relatively smooth contours, prominent nucleoli,
	and moderate quantities of heterochromatin. Basal lamina was present
	around many nests and cords of cells. This is the first such study
	of a tumor with this histology.},

@article{Ingvar1998,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of 0.07\% alcohol on regional
	brain activity at rest and during cognitive performance in order
	to elucidate the anatomical substrate for the effects of alcohol
	in man as well as to clarify the interaction between changes in cerebral
	activity induced by cognitive performance and alcohol inebriation.
	METHOD: Regional cerebral blood flow (3D-PET, 15O Butanol) was measured
	in 13 male, nonalcoholic volunteers. Each subject was scanned 12
	times, three scans in each of the following four situations: sober/rest,
	sober/test and inebriated/rest, inebriated/test. We used statistical
	parametric mapping and a computerized brain atlas for localization.
	RESULTS: Alcohol induced a sense of inebriation and elation as well
	as a relative increase of the cerebral blood flow in medial parts
	of the temporal lobes, in the anterobasal parts of the anterior cingulate
	cortex including the septal region. In addition, there was an increase
	of blood flow in midline parts of the lower brain stem. Relative
	decreases of flow were observed in the cerebellum and in the occipital
	cortex bilaterally. In the sober state, a computerized perceptual
	maze test and a (silent) serial seven test induced two distinct neocortical
	activation patterns that were specific to the tasks. Alcohol did
	not change these patterns and the test performance was also uninfluenced.
	CONCLUSIONS: A moderate dose of alcohol selectively activates target
	structures that pertain to the so-called cerebral reward system and
	the ascending reticular activating system. Alcohol (approximately
	0.07\%) appears to have only minor effects in the neocortical systems
	that are involved in on-line cognitive activity. This apparent independence
	between the subcortical alcohol target and the neocortical cognitive
	mechanisms is a new finding that appears to be of importance for
	an understanding of the effect of moderate doses of alcohol on the
	brain.},

	involved in monitoring performance, but precisely what is monitored
	remains unclear. A saccade-countermanding task affords an experimental
	dissociation of neural signals of error, reinforcement, and conflict.
	Single-unit activity was monitored in the anterior cingulate cortex
	of monkeys performing this task. Neurons that signaled errors were
	found, half of which responded to the omission of earned reinforcement.
	A further diversity of neurons signaled earned or unexpected reinforcement.
	No neurons signaled the form of conflict engendered by interruption
	of saccade preparation produced in this task. These results are consistent
	with the hypothesis that the anterior cingulate cortex monitors the
	consequences of actions.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the pattern
	of mediastinal dissemination of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors
	of testicular origin and evaluate variables that may influence survival
	with mediastinal dissection in patients with metastatic nonseminomatous
	germ cell tumors. METHODS: From 1981 to 2000, a total of 421 patients
	were seen at our institution for extirpation of residual lung or
	mediastinal disease after cisplatin-based chemotherapy for metastatic
	testicular nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. We reviewed 268 of these
	patients, with a mean age of 26.8 years, who required at least one
	surgical procedure to remove residual mediastinal disease. Pathologic
	types of resected residual mediastinal disease were necrosis (15\%),
	teratoma (59\%), persistent nonseminomatous germ cell cancer (15\%),
	and non-germ cell carcinomatous degeneration (11\%). Twelve variables
	were evaluated by univariate analyses, and four variables potentially
	statistically significant at P <.10 were subsequently entered into
	a Cox regression model. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated metastases
	to the visceral mediastinum. Fewer patients also demonstrated metastases
	to the paravertebral sulcus or anterior compartments (16\% and 7\%,
	respectively). Overall 5- and 10-year survivals were 86\% +/- 2\%
	and 74\% +/- 4\%, respectively. According to multivariate analysis,
	disease-related survival was negatively influenced by an elevated
	preoperative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level (P =.028) and
	adverse pathologic characteristics of residual mediastinal disease
	(P =.006). CONCLUSIONS: Testicular nonseminomatous germ cell tumors
	follow a predictable pattern of mediastinal dissemination, primarily
	following the course of the thoracic duct and its major tributaries.
	Patients who require surgery to remove residual mediastinal disease
	after cisplatin-based chemotherapy for metastatic nonseminomatous
	germ cell tumors have good to excellent long-term survivals. These
	results justify an aggressive surgical approach, including multiple
	surgical procedures if clinically indicated.},

	Forty of these patients underwent aneurysm repair by standard linear

	class, New York Heart Association functional classification, or survival.
	In 41 surviving patients, postoperative left ventricular dimensions

	measurements. No significant differences were found in postoperative
	long-axis left ventricular systolic diameter or in short-axis systolic
	or diastolic areas. There was a significantly larger long-axis diastolic
	diameter in the circular closure group; however, there was no difference
	in this parameter when the ratios of postoperative to preoperative
	lengths were compared. Further intragroup comparisons demonstrated
	an increase in short-axis areas postoperatively within the circular
	closure group in contrast to a decrease in patients in the linear
	closure group; these changes were not statistically significant.
	There was no significant difference in postoperative ejection fraction

@article{Kim1996,
	Abstract = {Behavioral stress has detrimental effects on subsequent cognitive
	performance in many species, including humans. For example, humans
	exposed to stressful situations typically exhibit marked deficits
	in various learning and memory tasks. However, the underlying neural
	mechanisms by which stress exerts its effects on learning and memory
	are unknown. We now report that in adult male rats, stress (i.e.,
	restraint plus tailshock) impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) but
	enhances long-term depression (LTD) in the CA1 area of the hippocampus,
	a structure implicated in learning and memory processes. These effects
	on LTP and LTD are prevented when the animals were given CGP39551
	(the carboxyethylester of CGP 37849; DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic
	acid), a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist,
	before experiencing stress. In contrast, the anxiolytic drug diazepam
	did not block the stress effects on hippocampal plasticity. Thus,
	the effects of stress on subsequent LTP and LTD appear to be mediated
	through the activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors.
	Such modifications in hippocampal plasticity may contribute to learning
	and memory impairments associated with stress.},

@article{Liu2003b,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A recent study identified a new class of compounds designated
	as the sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating
	protein (SCAP) ligands that putatively bind to SCAP, leading to increased
	LDL receptor (LDLR) expression. In this study, we examined the effects
	of SCAP ligand GW707 in comparison with lovastatin and cytokine oncostatin
	M (OM) on the regulation of LDLR expression in cultured HepG2 cells.
	METHODS AND RESULTS: Our studies uncovered several new features that
	distinguish SCAP ligand from lovastatin, a classic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
	coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and from OM, which utilize
	an SREBP-independent regulatory pathway. We show that the induction
	of LDLR mRNA expression by GW707 is not affected by intracellular
	cholesterol but is completely abolished by blocking de novo protein
	synthesis. Moreover, the effects of GW707 but not lovastatin on LDLR
	promoter activity, mRNA expression, and uptake of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanin
	perchlorate-LDL are markedly enhanced by OM. We further demonstrate
	that the amounts of the mature form of SREBP-2 translocated to the
	nucleus under GW707 treatment are increased by costimulating cells
	with OM. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide the first evidence that
	higher levels of LDLR expression and function can be achieved through
	simultaneous stimulation of the SREBP-dependent and SREBP-independent
	pathways, suggesting a strategy to develop an adjunct therapeutic
	intervention utilizing both pathways.},

	Abstract = {The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that individuals
	with substance abuse disorder exhibit structural deficits in the
	prefrontal cortex. Volumes of the prefrontal lobe in subjects with
	histories of polysubstance abuse (n = 25) were measured and compared
	with those in normal volunteers (n = 14), using high-resolution volumetric
	magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The research participants were
	men, 22 to 41 years of age. Polysubstance abusers were abstinent
	from drugs of abuse (except nicotine) for at least 15 days before
	MRI scanning. The total volumes of the prefrontal lobe (left and
	right hemispheres) were significantly smaller in the substance abuse
	group than in the control group. When the prefrontal lobe was segmented
	for gray and white matter, the deficit in the substance abusers was
	seen as significantly smaller volumes of gray but not of white matter.
	These results indicate that hypoplasia and/or atrophy in the prefrontal
	cortex accompany substance abuse and suggest that structural deficits
	in the prefrontal cortex may play an essential role in the neuropathological
	basis of functional impairments in substance abuse disorder, as demonstrated
	by functional brain imaging and cognitive studies.},

	Abstract = {The order of processing, whether global forms are processed prior
	to local forms or vice versa, has been of considerable interest.
	Many current theories hold that the more perceptually conspicuous
	form is identified first. An alternative view is presented here in
	which the stuctural relations among elements are an important factor
	in explaining the relative speeds of global and local processing.
	We equated the conspicuity of the global and local forms in three
	experiments and still found advantages in the processing of global
	forms. Subjects were able to process the relations among the elements
	quickly, even before the elements themselves were identified. According
	to our alternative view, subjects created equivalence classes of
	similar and proximate local elements before identifying the constituent
	elements. The experiments required subjects to decide whether two
	displays were the same or different, and consequently, the results
	are relevant to work in higher-level cognition that stresses the
	importance of comparison processes (e.g., analogy and conceptual
	combination). We conclude by evaluating related work in higher-level
	cognition in light of our findings.},

	Abstract = {Surgical treatment options for interruption of atrioventricular node
	reentrant tachycardia include (1) skeletonization of the atrioventricular
	node by dissecting it from most of its atrial inputs and (2) discrete
	cryosurgery of the perinodal tissues by applying a series of sequential
	cryolesions to the atrial tissues immediately adjacent to the atrioventricular
	node. Both these techniques attempt to interrupt one of the dual
	atrioventricular node conduction pathways while preserving the other.
	This report describes 17 consecutive patients who underwent surgical
	treatment, 10 patients with skeletonization of the atrioventricular
	node and seven patients with discrete perinodal cryosurgery. There
	were 10 female and seven male patients and their ages ranged from
	28 to 56 years (mean 38). Two of the 17 patients had Wolff-Parkinson-White
	syndrome and their accessory pathways were interrupted before the
	atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia was ablated. All the
	procedures were performed in a normothermic beating heart while atrioventricular
	conduction was monitored closely. In the skeletonization technique,
	the right atrial septum was mobilized and the atrioventricular node
	exposed anterior to the tendon of the Todaro. The perinodal cryosurgical
	procedure was also performed through a right atriotomy and a series
	of sequential 3 mm cryolesions were placed around the borders of
	the triangle of Koch on the inferior right atrial septum. There were
	no operative deaths. Two patients who underwent the skeletonization
	operation had heart block necessitating pacemaker therapy. At postoperative
	electrophysiologic study, no echoes or atrioventricular nodal reentrant
	tachycardia were inducible in any of the 17 patients. All patients
	have remained free of arrhythmia recurrence and have required no
	antiarrhythmic therapy after a follow-up of 5 to 28 months (mean
	14). In conclusion, both atrioventricular node skeletonization and
	perinodal cryosurgery successfully ablate atrioventricular nodal
	reentrant tachycardia; however, perinodal cryosurgery appears to
	be safer in avoiding heart block, is more easily performed, and is
	our procedure of choice for the management of medically refractory
	atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.},

	Abstract = {Kent bundle interruption for ventricular preexcitation has been successfully
	accomplished utilizing several different surgical techniques. The
	external closed-heart technique of Guiraudon combining surgical dissection
	and cryoablation has been used to interrupt 52 accessory pathways
	in 47 consecutive patients since May, 1985. The 35 male and 12 female
	patients ranged in age from 10 to 67 years (mean, 30 years). There
	were 25 left free wall, 13 right free wall, 13 posterior septal,
	and 1 anterior septal accessory pathways. Preoperative and intraoperative
	electrophysiological studies were performed in all patients to induce
	the arrhythmia and localize all accessory pathways. The operation
	consisted of dissection of the atrioventricular fat pad. Following
	this, the delta wave and retrograde accessory pathway conduction
	disappeared, thereby indicating successful pathway ablation. In 4
	patients with right-sided accessory pathways, interruption of the
	pathway required cryoablation. Cryolesions (made with cryoprobe at
	-60 degrees C for two minutes) were created in the region of the
	accessory pathway insertion. All accessory pathways were successfully
	ablated without any deaths or heart block. Concomitant surgical procedures
	were performed in 4 patients. Two patients required a second operation
	the next day for an accessory pathway not found at the initial operation.
	Three patients had postpericardiotomy syndrome, and 4 had recurrent
	atrial fibrillation requiring therapy. The remaining patients have
	had no arrhythmia recurrence and have remained drug free after a
	follow-up of 1 month to 22 months (mean, 12.5 months). We conclude
	that the closed-heart technique of accessory pathway ablation is
	safe and reproducible, obviates the necessity for aortic cross-clamping
	and cardioplegic arrest, and allows instantaneous monitoring of conduction
	over the pathway.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Impaired decision-making is one diagnostic characteristic
	of alcoholism. Quantifying decision-making with rapid and robust
	laboratory-based measures is thus desirable for the testing of novel
	treatments for alcoholism. Previous research has demonstrated the
	utility of delay discounting (DD) tasks for quantifying differences
	in decision-making in substance abusers and normal controls. In DD
	paradigms subjects choose between a small, immediate reward and a
	larger, delayed reward. METHODS: We used a novel computerized DD
	task to demonstrate that abstinent alcoholics (AA, n=14) choose the
	larger, delayed option significantly less often than control subjects
	(n=14; p<0.02). This difference in choice tendency was independent
	of subject age, gender, years of education, or socio-economic status.
	RESULTS: All subjects discounted as a function of reward delay and
	amount, with alcoholics demonstrating steeper discounting curves
	for both variables. This tendency to discount delayed rewards was
	positively correlated with subjective reports of both alcohol addiction
	severity (Drug Use Screening Inventory-Revised, Domain 1, p<0.01),
	and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11, p<0.004). Novel aspects
	of this new paradigm include an element of time pressure, an additional
	experimental condition that evaluated motor impulsivity by assessing
	the ability to inhibit a pre-potent response, and another control
	condition to requiring non-subjective choice. CONCLUSIONS: Non-alcoholic
	controls and alcoholics did not differ on motor impulsivity or non-subjective
	choice, suggesting that the differing choice behavior of the two
	groups was due mainly to differences in cognitive impulsivity.},

	use illicit drugs (n = 17) participated in tests of delay discounting
	with hypothetical money rewards. We then used a derived estimate
	of each individual's delay discounting to generate a functional magnetic
	resonance imaging probe task consisting of three conditions: "hard
	choices," requiring selections between "smaller, sooner" and "larger,
	later" alternatives that were similarly valued given the individual's
	delay discounting; "easy choices," in which alternatives differed
	dramatically in value; and a "no choice" control condition. MA abusers
	exhibited more delay discounting than control subjects (P < 0.05).
	Across groups, the "hard choice > no choice" contrast revealed significant
	effects in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal
	cortex (DLPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and areas surrounding
	the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). With group comparisons limited to
	these clusters, the "hard choice > easy choice" contrast indicated
	significant group differences in task-related activity within the
	left DLPFC and right IPS; qualitatively similar nonsignificant effects
	were present in the other clusters tested. Whereas control subjects
	showed less recruitment associated with easy than with hard choices,
	MA abusers generally did not. Correlational analysis did not indicate
	a relationship between this anomaly in frontoparietal recruitment
	and greater degree of delay discounting exhibited by MA abusers.
	Therefore, while apparent inefficiency of cortical processing related
	to decision-making in MA abusers may contribute to the neural basis
	of enhanced delay discounting by this population, other factors remain
	to be identified.},

	scale were used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms
	in primary depressive illness in the combined sample. Ratings on
	these 17 items for 64 patients participating in studies of four different
	antidepressant drugs were used to create a depression scale consisting
	of the 10 items which showed the largest changes with treatment and
	the highest correlation to overall change. The inner-rater reliability
	of the new depression scale was high. Scores on the scale correlated
	significantly with scores on a standard rating scale for depression,
	the Hamilton Rating Scale (HRS), indicating its validity as a general
	severity estimate. Its capacity to differentiate between responders
	and non-responders to antidepressant treatment was better than the

	Abstract = {Impulsivity is frequently associated with bipolar disorder (BD) during
	manic episodes, but may also be present in euthymic bipolar patients.
	Aggression is an impulsivity-related behavior also found during manic
	episodes. The objective of this review is to further clarify the
	relationship between impulsivity and BD. A search in Medline and
	Psycinfo databases, combined with a manual search of selected references,
	was conducted to identify available literature on BD and impulsivity-related
	features. Although few studies have directly measured impulsivity
	in BD, available findings suggest that impulsivity is not only state-related,
	but also a trait component of BD, which could represent a core feature
	of the illness. Further research exploring the neurobiology of the
	impulsivity/BD relationship may contribute to elucidate the pathophysiology
	and to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this severe illness.},

@article{Nakamura2000,
	Abstract = {Nicotine produces profound behavioral effects in humans, but little
	is known about the sites of its action. There is a hypothesis that
	frontal lobe and limbic/cingulate cortical structures might be the
	sites. In this study, we examined the effects of cigarette smoking
	on feeling and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in human subjects. Young
	and healthy 9 cigarette smokers (all males, 24-33 years, average,
	26.4) were included. After prohibiting them from smoking for 15 hours,
	CBF was measured using a Xenon CT-CBF system. Fifteen minutes later
	after allowing them to smoke two pieces of cigarette, the second
	CBF measurement was performed. Subtraction CBF map was created to
	display the changes after smoking. CT images were taken at three
	levels so as to include the cerebral lobes, basal ganglia, limbic
	system, brainstem and cerebellum. Arterial nicotine increased up
	to the levels 8 times higher than before smoking. The increases of
	blood pressure and pulse rate were minimal. Arterial carbon dioxide
	level and hematocrit did not change. Feeling after smoking was variable
	in individual subject. In 8 subjects with a relatively high feeling,
	CBF increased mainly in the frontal lobe, hippocampus, uncus, thalamus
	and caudate nucleus. CBF did not change in the parietal, temporal
	and occipital lobes, and in the putamen, insula, brainstem and cerebellum.
	In two subjects with uncomfortable feeling, CBF did reduce in the
	whole brain. The CBF increase in frontal lobe and limbic structures
	seems to be secondary to nicotine-induced neuronal activation in
	each structure. Mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, which is believed
	to influence learning, memory or emotional performance, appears to
	be a target for nicotine. The CBF reduction in the whole brain might
	be due to cerebral vasoconstriction or be secondary to a systemic
	hypotension.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive power of executive functions,
	in particular, response inhibition, in relation to alcohol-related
	problems and illicit drug use in adolescence. METHOD: A total of
	498 children from 275 families from a longitudinal high-risk study
	completed executive function measures in early and late adolescence
	and lifetime drinking and drug-related ratings at multiple time points
	including late adolescence (ages 15-17). Multi-informant measures
	of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder
	were obtained in early childhood (ages 3-5), middle childhood, and
	adolescence. RESULTS: In multilevel models, poor response inhibition
	predicted aggregate alcohol-related problems, the number of illicit
	drugs used, and comorbid alcohol and drug use (but not the number
	of drug-related problems), independently of IQ, parental alcoholism
	and antisocial personality disorder, child attention-deficit/hyperactivity
	disorder and conduct symptoms, or age. Multivariate models explained
	8\% to 20\% of residual variance in outcome scores. The incremental
	predictive power of response inhibition was modest, explaining about
	1\% of the variance in most outcomes, but more than 9\% of the residual
	variance in problem outcomes within the highest risk families. Other
	measured executive functions did not independently predict substance
	use onset. CONCLUSION: Models of alcoholism and other drug risks
	that invoke executive functions may benefit from specifying response
	inhibition as an incremental component.},

	Abstract = {A growing literature supports a role for neurocognitive deficits such
	as impaired decision-making in the development and maintenance of
	addictive behaviour. On the basis of these findings, it has been
	suggested that measures of neurocognitive functioning may be applied
	to the task of predicting clinical outcome in drug addiction. This
	in turn may have relevance for differentiating treatment based on
	individual patient needs. To explore this hypothesis we obtained
	neurocognitive measures of planning, impulsivity and decision-making
	from 37 opiate dependent individuals within 6 weeks of starting a
	community drug treatment programme and we followed them up 3 months
	into the programme. Performance on two tests of decision-making,
	but not on tests of planning, motor inhibition, reflection impulsivity
	or delay discounting, was found to predict abstinence from illicit
	drugs at 3 months with high specificity and moderate sensitivity.
	In particular, two thirds of the participants performing normally
	on the Cambridge Gamble Task and the Iowa Gambling Task, but none
	of those impaired on both, were abstinent from illicit drugs at follow
	up. Other neuropsychological, psychiatric or psychosocial factors
	measured in this sample did not explain this finding. The results
	are discussed in terms of the brain circuitry involved and the potential
	implications for the planning of treatment services for opiate dependence.},

@article{Passetti2008a,
	Abstract = {A growing literature supports a role for neurocognitive deficits such
	as impaired decision-making in the development and maintenance of
	addictive behaviour. On the basis of these findings, it has been
	suggested that measures of neurocognitive functioning may be applied
	to the task of predicting clinical outcome in drug addiction. This
	in turn may have relevance for differentiating treatment based on
	individual patient needs. To explore this hypothesis we obtained
	neurocognitive measures of planning, impulsivity and decision-making
	from 37 opiate dependent individuals within 6 weeks of starting a
	community drug treatment programme and we followed them up 3 months
	into the programme. Performance on two tests of decision-making,
	but not on tests of planning, motor inhibition, reflection impulsivity
	or delay discounting, was found to predict abstinence from illicit
	drugs at 3 months with high specificity and moderate sensitivity.
	In particular, two thirds of the participants performing normally
	on the Cambridge Gamble Task and the Iowa Gambling Task, but none
	of those impaired on both, were abstinent from illicit drugs at follow
	up. Other neuropsychological, psychiatric or psychosocial factors
	measured in this sample did not explain this finding. The results
	are discussed in terms of the brain circuitry involved and the potential
	implications for the planning of treatment services for opiate dependence.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Impulsivity is a key component of the manic behavior of
	bipolar disorder and is reported to occur in bipolar patients as
	a stable characteristic, i.e. a trait. Nevertheless, impulsivity
	has not been widely studied in depressed bipolar patients. We assessed
	impulsivity in depressed and euthymic bipolar and unipolar patients
	and healthy controls. We hypothesized that bipolar subjects would
	have higher levels of trait impulsivity than the comparison groups.
	METHODS: Twenty-four depressed bipolar, 24 depressed unipolar, 12
	euthymic bipolar, and 10 euthymic unipolar patients, as well as 51
	healthy subjects were evaluated with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale
	(BIS). Analysis of covariance with age and sex as covariates was
	used to compare mean group differences. RESULTS: Depressed bipolar,
	euthymic bipolar, and depressed unipolar patients did not differ,
	and showed greater impulsivity than healthy controls on all of the
	BIS scales. Euthymic unipolar patients scored higher than healthy
	controls only on motor impulsivity. LIMITATIONS: Higher number of
	past substance abusers in the bipolar groups, and no control for
	anxiety and personality disorders, as well as small sample sizes,
	limit the reach of this study. CONCLUSIONS: This study replicates
	prior findings of stable trait impulsivity in bipolar disorder patients,
	and extends them, confirming that this trait can be demonstrated
	in depressed patients, as well as manic and euthymic ones. Trait
	impulsivity may be the result of repeated mood episodes or be present
	prior to their onset, either way it would influence the clinical
	presentation of bipolar disorder.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Impulsivity is a multifaceted construct that has recently
	been recognized as a factor contributing to enhanced vulnerability

	facets of impulsivity (and tasks that measure them): (1) impulsive
	choice (delay discounting task) and (2) inhibitory failure (go/no-go,
	stop signal reaction time, and five-choice serial reaction time tasks).
	We also describe how performance on each of these tasks is associated
	with drug-related behavior during phases of drug abuse that capture
	the essential features of addiction (acquisition, escalation, and
	reinstatement of drug-seeking after drug access has terminated).
	Three hypotheses (H) regarding the relationship between impulsivity
	and drug abuse are discussed: (1) increased levels of impulsivity
	lead to drug abuse (H1), (2) drugs of abuse increase impulsivity
	(H2), and (3) impulsivity and drug abuse are associated through a
	common third factor (H3). CONCLUSION: Impulsivity expressed as impulsive
	choice or inhibitory failure plays a role in several key transition
	phases of drug abuse. There is evidence to support all three nonexclusive
	hypotheses. Increased levels of impulsivity lead to acquisition of
	drug abuse (H1) and subsequent escalation or dysregulation of drug
	intake. Drugs of abuse may increase impulsivity (H2), which is an
	additional contributor to escalation/dysregulation. Abstinence, relapse,
	and treatment may be influenced by both H1 and H2. In addition, there
	is a relationship between impulsivity and other drug abuse vulnerability
	factors, such as sex, hormonal status, reactivity to nondrug rewards,
	and early environmental experiences that may impact drug intake during
	all phases of addiction (H3). Relating drug abuse and impulsivity
	in phases of addiction via these three hypotheses provides a heuristic

	Abstract = {AIMS: To investigate whether heroin addicts demonstrate shortened
	time horizons and decreased sensitivity to future consequences of
	their behavior compared to non-drug users. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:
	Thirty-four heroin addicts enrolled in a buprenorphine treatment
	clinic and 59 non-drug-using controls completed a personality questionnaire
	and two laboratory tasks. MEASUREMENTS: The Stanford Time Perception
	Inventory (STPI) personality questionnaire assessed orientation to
	the future, and the Future Time Perspective (FTP) task elicited predictions
	of the timing and ordering of future events. The Bechara card task
	measured preferences for decks of cards that range in magnitude and
	probability of delayed and immediate rewards and punishers. FINDINGS:
	Heroin addicts scored significantly lower than controls on the STPI
	scale indicative of future orientation. In the FTP, heroin addicts
	were less likely to predict events far into the future and less likely
	to systematically organize events in the future. In the card task,
	heroin addicts were less likely to win money than controls. They
	were more likely to play from a deck that contained greater immediate
	gains but that resulted in large, delayed punishers and overall net
	losses. They also made fewer selections from a deck that provided
	an overall net gain via relatively low immediate rewards and frequent
	small punishments. CONCLUSIONS: Shortened time horizons and decreased
	sensitivity to delayed consequences may explain drug abusers' persistent
	use of drugs, despite the long-term negative consequences associated
	with drug use.},

	Abstract = {This study evaluated delay discounting functions of substance abusing

	Abstract = {The dopamine-containing projection from the ventral tegmental area
	of the midbrain to the nucleus accumbens is critically involved in
	mediating the reinforcing properties of cocaine. Although neurons
	in this area respond to rewards on a subsecond timescale, neurochemical
	studies have only addressed the role of dopamine in drug addiction
	by examining changes in the tonic (minute-to-minute) levels of extracellular
	dopamine. To investigate the role of phasic (subsecond) dopamine
	signalling, we measured dopamine every 100 ms in the nucleus accumbens
	using electrochemical technology. Rapid changes in extracellular
	dopamine concentration were observed at key aspects of drug-taking
	behaviour in rats. Before lever presses for cocaine, there was an
	increase in dopamine that coincided with the initiation of drug-seeking
	behaviours. Notably, these behaviours could be reproduced by electrically
	evoking dopamine release on this timescale. After lever presses,
	there were further increases in dopamine concentration at the concurrent
	presentation of cocaine-related cues. These cues alone also elicited
	similar, rapid dopamine signalling, but only in animals where they
	had previously been paired to cocaine delivery. These findings reveal
	an unprecedented role for dopamine in the regulation of drug taking
	in real time.},

	benefit from this type of therapy? A tentative answer is given to
	these three questions. In depressive patients the cerebral MA turnover
	can be diminished. These disorders do not occur in all patients but
	seem to be confined to certain categories of depression. Diminution
	or non-diminution of the central MA turnover is a (not the) factor

@article{Praag1975d,
	Abstract = {A strategy is presented for biological psychosis research with neuroleptics
	acting as a point of crystallisation like antidepressants do in biological
	depression research. The neuroleptics chlorpromazine, haloperidol
	and oxypertine were studied, and it was found that they influence
	central catecholamine (CA) metabolism in man. An increased central
	dopamine (DA) turnover was found to occur in psychotic disorders,
	mostly in the form of motor agitation. As the first of a planned
	series of studies, chlorpromazine with presumed ability to reduce
	both DA-ergic and noradrenaline (NA)-ergic transmission and oxypertine
	as a more selective blocker of NA-ergic transmission were selected
	for comparison. The overall therapeutic effect of oxypertine was
	inferior to that of chlorpromazine, whereas oxypertine proved more
	effective in cases where loss of initiative was predominant. On the
	other hand, chlorpromazine exerted a more marked influence on extrapyramidal
	motor functions than oxypertine. In chronic psychotic disorders with
	inertia, oxypertine thus seems to be a neuroleptic which is strong
	enough to prevent exacerbation of delusions and hallucinations while
	at the same time increasing the level of motivation. These findings
	were in accordance with our predictions. The comparative study is
	illustrative of the practical significance of the research approach

	Abstract = {Subliminal priming is said to occur when a subliminal prime influences
	the classification of a subsequent target. Most subliminal-priming
	claims are based on separate target- and prime-classification tasks.
	Because primes are intended to be subliminal, the prime-classification
	task is difficult, and the target-classification task is easy. To
	assess whether this task-difficulty difference accounts for previous
	claims of subliminal priming, we manipulated the ease of the prime-classification
	task by intermixing long-duration (visible) primes with short-duration
	(near liminal) ones. In Experiment 1, this strategy of intermixing
	long-duration primes raised classification of the short-duration
	ones. In Experiments 2 and 3, prime duration was lowered in such
	a way that prime classification was at chance in intermixed presentations.
	Under these conditions, we failed to observe any priming effects;
	hence, previous demonstrations of subliminal priming may simply have
	reflected a task-difficulty artifact.},

	for 2-choice decisions was applied to data from 2 letter identification
	experiments. In the experiments, stimulus letters were displayed
	and then masked, and the stimulus onset asynchrony between letter
	and mask was manipulated to vary accuracy from near chance to near
	ceiling. A standard reaction time procedure was used in one experiment
	and a deadline procedure in the other. Two hypotheses about the effect
	of masking on the information provided to the decision process were
	contrasted: (a) The output of perception to the decision process
	varies with time, so that the information used by the decision process
	rises and falls, reflecting the stimulus onset and mask onset. (b)
	The output of perception to the decision is constant over time, reflecting
	information integrated over the time between the stimulus and mask
	onsets. The data were well fit by the diffusion model only with the
	assumption of constant information over time.},

	that mediate the bizarreness effect, that is, the finding that bizarre
	or unusual imagery is recalled better than common imagery. In all
	experiments, subjects were presented with noun pairs that were embedded
	within bizarre or common sentences in a mixed-list design. None of
	the experiments produced a bizarreness effect for cued recall; however,
	for two of the experiments, the bizarre noun pairs were remembered
	significantly better than the common pairs for free recall. To determine
	if these differences were due to the storage or retrieval of the
	items, a multinomial model for the analysis of imagery mediation
	in paired-associate learning was developed and applied to the data
	from the experiments. The model revealed that bizarre sentences benefited
	the retrieval of the noun pairs but not their storage within memory.
	The empirical and modeling results are discussed relative to previous
	findings and theories on the bizarreness effect.},

	Abstract = {We used a novel computerized decision-making task to compare the decision-making
	behavior of chronic amphetamine abusers, chronic opiate abusers,
	and patients with focal lesions of orbital prefrontal cortex (PFC)
	or dorsolateral/medial PFC. We also assessed the effects of reducing
	central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) activity using a tryptophan-depleting
	amino acid drink in normal volunteers. Chronic amphetamine abusers
	showed suboptimal decisions (correlated with years of abuse), and
	deliberated for significantly longer before making their choices.
	The opiate abusers exhibited only the second of these behavioral
	changes. Importantly, both sub-optimal choices and increased deliberation
	times were evident in the patients with damage to orbitofrontal PFC
	but not other sectors of PFC. Qualitatively, the performance of the
	subjects with lowered plasma tryptophan was similar to that associated
	with amphetamine abuse, consistent with recent reports of depleted
	5-HT in the orbital regions of PFC of methamphetamine abusers. Overall,
	these data suggest that chronic amphetamine abusers show similar
	decision-making deficits to those seen after focal damage to orbitofrontal
	PFC. These deficits may reflect altered neuromodulation of the orbitofrontal

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychological studies in subjects with bipolar disorder
	(BD) have reported deficits on a variety of cognitive measures. However,
	because the majority of subjects were medicated at the time of testing
	in previous studies, it is currently unclear whether the pattern
	of deficits reported is related to BD itself or to psychotropic medication.
	We addressed this issue by examining cognitive performance in a group
	of unmedicated, currently depressed subjects with BD. METHODS: Forty-nine
	unmedicated subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for BD, depressed phase,
	and 55 control subjects participated in this study. Most patients
	were diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. Performance on emotion-dependent,
	or 'hot', and emotion-independent, or 'cold', cognitive tasks was
	assessed using tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated
	Battery. RESULTS: The groups were well matched with respect to general
	intelligence and demographic variables. Deficits in the unmedicated
	depressed BD group were apparent on tests tapping 'hot' cognitive
	processing, for example the Cambridge Gamble task and the Probabilistic
	Reversal Learning task. However, other than a deficit on the Spatial
	Span test in the depressed BD subjects, the groups performed equivalently
	on most measures of 'cold' cognitive processing, for example visual
	memory, attention, and working memory. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest
	that deficits on tests involving reward processing, short-term spatial
	memory storage, and sensitivity to negative feedback in depressed
	BD subjects represent an effect of the illness itself and not mood-stabilizing
	medication.},

	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Anhedonia, or hyposensitivity to normally pleasurable stimuli,
	is a cardinal symptom of depression. As such, reward circuitry may
	comprise a substrate with relevance to this symptom of depression.
	OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to characterize in the rat changes in the
	rewarding properties of a pharmacological and a natural stimulus
	following olfactory bulbectomy (OBX), a pre-clinical animal model
	of depression. METHODS: We measured amphetamine enhancement of brain
	stimulation reward, changes in sucrose intake, as well as striatal
	cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activity, a molecular
	index previously associated with depressant-like behavior. Moreover,
	since alteration of psychomotor activity is also a common symptom
	of depression, and psychostimulant reward and locomotion are thought
	to share common neurobiology, we used the same treatment schedule
	of amphetamine to probe for changes in locomotion. RESULTS: Our findings
	show that OBX produces a behavioral phenotype characterized by both
	anhedonia and exaggerated locomotor activation. Thus, we observed
	a blunted response to the rewarding properties of amphetamine (1
	mg/kg, 21 days post-lesion), a long-lasting reduction in sucrose
	intake and increased striatal CREB activity. In addition, the same
	dose of amphetamine, at a coincident time post-lesion, triggered
	an exaggerated response to its locomotor-stimulant actions. CONCLUSIONS:
	These paradoxical findings are not consistent with the notion that
	reward and locomotion are mediated by a common substrate; this dissociation
	may be useful in modeling psychiatric disorders such as mixed depressive
	states. In addition, our findings suggest that central reward circuitry
	may constitute a possible target for rationally designed therapeutics
	for depression.},

	Abstract = {Many models of response time assume that subjects accrue stimulus
	"evidence" samples in time (e.g., random walk models, counter models).
	In this paper, the concept of one stimulus dominating another is
	used to construct a test of the whole class of evidence accrual models.
	For an example of dominance, consider stimuli that are presented
	either virtually instantaneously (stepped) or in a gradually increasing
	manner (ramped). Ramped stimuli are presented such that the ramped
	portion precedes the stepped onset of stepped stimuli. In this case
	ramped stimuli dominate stepped stimuli. In this paper the class
	of evidence accrual models is formalized. It is shown that under
	appropriate assumptions evidence accrual models do predict more accurate
	responses to dominating stimuli. However, this result does not hold
	for response latencies. There are anomalous cases where an evidence
	accrual model (the accumulator model of Vickers (1970, Ergonomics
	13, 37-58)) predicts slower mean correct response latencies to dominating
	stimuli. It is shown through extensive computer simulation that these
	anomalous cases occur only when response criteria are so asymmetric
	that there are exceedingly extreme response biases. For experiments
	where response biases are not exceedingly extreme, random walk and
	accumulator models predict more accurate and quicker correct responses

	Abstract = {Many models of perceptual processing assume that participants integrate
	stimulus evidence over time, for example, random walk models. This
	class of models is tested in a luminance discrimination paradigm
	in which the onsets of the stimuli are either instantaneous (stepped)
	or slowly ramped. The ramped portion of ramped stimuli occurs prior
	to the stepped stimuli onsets. Consequently, there is more luminance
	energy in ramped stimuli. Therefore, if participants integrate luminance
	energy, they should perform better to ramped stimuli. This did not
	occur in 4 experiments. Participants performed better to stepped
	stimuli than ramped stimuli in earlier foreperiods and the reverse
	in later foreperiods. A new model is proposed in which participants
	monitor both integrated luminance energy and quick temporal changes
	in luminance, but they do so in a serial fashion. First, participants
	monitor temporal changes in luminance; later, they monitor integrated
	luminance energy.},

	Abstract = {In a speeded choice reaction time task, responses to centrally presented
	letter targets can be altered by the identity of surrounding task-irrelevant
	letters (flankers). In the standard flanker effect, flankers associated
	with the same response as the target lead to faster and more accurate
	responses, whereas flankers associated with a different response
	lead to slower and more error-prone responses. B. A. Eriksen and
	C. W. Eriksen (1974, pp. 143-149) have argued that these flanker
	effects occur through response competition. We present data from
	a novel version of the Eriksen task, in which some targets and flankers
	consist of letter forms that are morphed versions of target letters.
	In this paradigm, flankers induce classic flanker effects on well-formed
	targets. But flankers induce an opposite effect, termed a negative
	flanker effect on morphed letter targets. For example, targets that
	are morphs between the letters "A" and "H" are more likely to be
	identified as an "A" when flanked by an "H." The interpretation advanced

	the advent of the theory of signal detection, however, discrete-state
	theory and the corresponding notion of threshold have been discounted.
	Consequently, phenomena such as subliminal priming and perception

	definition of threshold that allows for graded perception and activation
	throughout the system. Thresholds correspond to maximum stimulus
	intensities such that the distribution of mental states does not
	differ from that when an appropriate baseline stimulus is presented.
	In practice, thresholds are maximum intensities such that the probability
	distribution on behavioral events does not differ from that from
	baseline. These thresholds, which the authors call task thresholds,

	Abstract = {Vincentizing (quantile averaging) is a popular means of pooling response
	time distributions across individuals to produce a group average.
	The benefit of Vincentizing is that the resulting histogram "looks
	like" an average of the individuals. In this article, we competitively
	test Vincentizing against the more mundane approach of averaging
	parameter estimates from fits to individuals. We simulate data from
	three distributions: the ex-Gaussian, the Weibull, and the shifted-Wald.
	For the ex-Gaussian and the shifted-Wald, parameter averaging outperforms
	Vincentizing. There is only an advantage of Vincentizing for the
	Weibull and only when there are few observations per participant.
	Overall, we recommend that researchers use Vincentizing only in select
	circumstances and with the knowledge that Vincentized estimates are
	often inconsistent estimators of averaged parameters.},

	experimental approaches, using lesions, inactivation, and cell recording,

	Here we review these results and integrate them with those from neuroimaging.
	A medial superior frontal gyrus (SFG) region centred on the pre-supplementary
	motor area (pre-SMA) is involved in the selection of action sets
	whereas the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has a fundamental role
	in relating actions to their consequences, both positive reinforcement
	outcomes and errors, and in guiding decisions about which actions
	are worth making.},

	Abstract = {Anomalous coronary artery (ACA) anatomy occurs in 2-9\% of patients
	with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), in which the left anterior descending
	coronary artery (LAD) originates from the right coronary artery (RCA)
	crossing the right ventricular outflow tract. The purpose of this
	study was to review our results of repair for TOF with ACA. Between
	1978 and 2001, 43 ACA patients (mean age, 4.8 years; range, 5 months-41
	years) underwent repair for TC. The ACA anatomy was classified as
	the single LAD from the RCA (n = 20), a significant conal branch
	(dual LAD) from the RCA (n = 13), paired anterior descending arteries
	originating from the left and right coronary arteries (n = 7), and
	single RCA from the LAD (n = 3). In cases in which the anomalous
	LAD crossed the obstructed infundibulum, thinning or coring of the
	endocardium was done. Patch infundibuloplasty was performed in 39
	patients, with 10 needing separate RV and pulmonary artery patches,
	and the pulmonary valve was preserved. Nine patients had the addition
	of a monocusp to a transannular incision. Two patients had a main
	pulmonary arterioplasty alone. There was one early (2.3\%) and no
	late deaths. Mean early and late postoperative gradients were 21.5
	+/- 10.5 mmHg (4 patients had > or =30 mmHg) and 27.1 +/- 13.7 mmHg
	(5 patients had >30 mmHg; p = 0.12), respectively. There were four
	reoperations during a mean follow-up of 4.8 years (range, 6 months
	to 18 years). Actuarial freedom from reoperation was 90\% at 5, 10,
	and 15 years. At the latest follow-up, all patients were in NYHA
	functional class I. TOF repair for an ACA can be performed without
	disturbing the native coronary anatomy and without the use of conduits
	in most cases. Outcomes are similar to those of other patients with
	TOF. The presence of ACA does not impose increased risk after this
	surgical strategy.},

	are difficult to distinguish, habitual responses must be overcome,
	or consequences are uncertain, deliberation is necessary and a supervisory
	system exerts control over the processes that produce sensory-guided
	movements. We have investigated these processes by recording neural
	activity in the frontal lobe of macaque monkeys performing a countermanding
	task. Distinct neurons in the frontal eye field respond to visual
	stimuli or control the production of the movements. In the supplementary
	eye field and anterior cingulate cortex, neurons appear not to control
	directly movement initiation but instead signal the production of
	errors, the anticipation and delivery of reinforcement, and the presence
	of processing conflict. These signals form the core of current models
	of supervisory control of sensorimotor processes.},

	Abstract = {Studies using brain imaging methods have shown that neuronal activity
	in the orbitofrontal cortex, a brain area thought to promote the
	ability to control behavior according to likely outcomes or consequences,
	is altered in drug addicts. These human imaging findings have led
	to the hypothesis that core features of addiction like compulsive
	drug use and drug relapse are mediated in part by drug-induced changes
	in orbitofrontal function. Here, we discuss results from laboratory
	studies using rats and monkeys on the effect of drug exposure on
	orbitofrontal-mediated learning tasks and on neuronal structure and
	activity in orbitofrontal cortex. We also discuss results from studies
	on the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in drug self-administration
	and relapse. Our main conclusion is that although there is clear
	evidence that drug exposure impairs orbitofrontal-dependent learning
	tasks and alters neuronal activity in orbitofrontal cortex, the precise
	role these changes play in compulsive drug use and relapse has not
	yet been established.},

	Abstract = {The personality systems of Cloninger (as measured by the Tridimensional
	Personality Questionnaire [TPQ]) and Eysenck (as measured by the
	Eysenck Personality Questionnaire [EPQ]) both have been linked to
	substance use and abuse. The current study examined the predictive
	utility of both systems for substance use disorder (SUD) diagnoses,
	both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Participants (N = 489 at
	baseline) completed the EPQ and TPQ and were assessed via structured
	diagnostic interview at baseline and 6 years later (N = 457 at follow-up).
	Both the EPQ and TPQ scales demonstrated bivariate cross-sectional
	and prospective associations with SUDs. Within each system, those
	dimensions marking a broad impulsive sensation-seeking or behavioral
	disinhibition trait were the best predictors prospectively, although
	the 2 systems were differentially sensitive to specific diagnoses.
	These relations remained significant even with autoregressivity,
	other concurrent SUD diagnoses, and multiple personality dimensions
	statistically controlled.},

	method of estimating response time distributions. Their method may
	have practical advantages over conventional maximum likelihood estimation.
	The basic idea is that the likelihood of parameters is maximized
	given a few quantiles from the data. We show that Heathcote et al.'s
	likelihood function is not correct and provide the appropriate correction.
	However, although our correction stands on firmer theoretical ground
	than Heathcote et al.'s, it appears to yield worse parameter estimates.
	This result further indicates that, at least for some distributions
	and situations, quantile maximum likelihood estimation may have better
	nonasymptotic properties than a more theoretically justified approach.},

	as a result of over-production and aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta)
	peptides in the brain. The reason for variation in the gravity of
	symptoms among AD patients is unknown and might result from patient-related
	factors including lifestyle. Individuals suffering from chronic stress
	are at an increased risk for developing AD. This study investigated
	the effect of chronic psychosocial stress in Abeta rat model of AD.
	METHODS: Psychosocial stress was induced with a rat intruder model.
	The rat model of AD was induced by 14-day osmotic pump infusion of
	a mixture of 300 pmol/day Abeta(1-40)/Abeta(1-42). The effect of
	chronic stress on the severity of Abeta-induced spatial learning
	and memory impairment was tested by three approaches: behavioral
	testing in the radial arm water maze, in vivo electrophysiological
	recording in anesthetized rat, and immunoblot analysis to determine
	protein levels of learning- and memory-related molecules. RESULTS:
	A marked impairment of learning and memory developed when stress
	was combined with Abeta, more so than that caused by Abeta alone.
	Additionally, there was a significantly greater impairment of early-phase
	long-term potentiation (E-LTP) in chronically stressed/Abeta-treated
	rats than in either the stressed or Abeta-treated rats. This might
	be a manifestation of the reduction in protein levels of calcium/calmodulin-dependent
	protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the abnormal increase in calcineurin
	levels. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic stress significantly intensified Abeta-induced
	deficits of short-term memory and E-LTP by a mechanism involving
	decreased CaMKII activation along with increased calcineurin levels.},

	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Repeated amphetamine (AMPH) exposure is known to cause
	long-term changes in AMPH-induced locomotor behavior (i.e., sensitization)
	that are associated with similarly long-lasting changes in brain
	function. It is not clear, however, if such exposure produces long-lasting
	changes in a cognitive behavior that, in humans, is hypothesized
	to contribute to addiction. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether repeated
	AMPH exposure induces both locomotor sensitization and alters impulsive
	choice in a delay-discounting task. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult,
	male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 29) were pretreated with 3.0 mg/kg
	AMPH or saline every other day for 20 days and were then trained
	to lever press for small, immediately delivered food reinforcement
	or larger reinforcements delivered after delays. We subsequently
	assessed the effects of acute AMPH (0.1-2.0 mg/kg) on delay-discounting.
	Lastly, we tested for long-lasting effects of pretreatment by giving
	an AMPH challenge (3.0 mg/kg) 1 week after the final delay-discounting
	session. RESULTS: Repeated AMPH produced sensitization to the drug's
	stereotypy-inducing effects but did not alter acquisition or baseline
	behavior in the delay-discounting task. Following acute AMPH, impulsive
	choice and other measures of delay-discounting were altered, but
	to a similar extent in both saline- and AMPH-pretreated groups. The
	AMPH challenge, given approximately 3 months after the last pretreatment
	injection, revealed that sensitization was still evident. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our results suggest that one behavioral consequence of repeated AMPH
	exposure-sensitization-does not overlap with another potential outcome-increased
	impulsivity. Furthermore, the neuroadaptations known to be associated
	with sensitization may be somewhat distinct from those that lead
	to changes in impulsive choice.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, and cigarette
	smoking is a major cause of premature death among humans. Little
	is known about the neuropharmacology and sites of action of nicotine
	in the human brain. Such knowledge might help in the development
	of new behavioral and pharmacological therapies to aid in treating
	nicotine dependence and to improve smoking cessation success rates.
	METHOD: Functional magnetic resonance imaging, a real-time imaging
	technique, was used to determine the acute CNS effects of intravenous
	nicotine in 16 active cigarette smokers. An injection of saline followed
	by injections of three doses of nicotine (0.75, 1.50, and 2.25 mg/70
	kg of weight) were each administered intravenously over 1-minute
	periods in an ascending, cumulative-dosing paradigm while whole brain
	gradient-echo, echo-planar images were acquired every 6 seconds during
	consecutive 20-minute trials. RESULTS: Nicotine induced a dose-dependent
	increase in several behavioral parameters, including feelings of
	"rush" and "high" and drug liking. Nicotine also induced a dose-dependent
	increase in neuronal activity in a distributed system of brain regions,
	including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, cingulate, and frontal
	lobes. Activation in these structures is consistent with nicotine's
	behavior-arousing and behavior-reinforcing properties in humans.
	CONCLUSIONS: The identified brain regions have been previously shown
	to participate in the reinforcing, mood-elevating, and cognitive
	properties of other abused drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and
	opiates, suggesting that nicotine acts similarly in the human brain
	to produce its reinforcing and dependence properties.},

	In mixed states, mania-associated impulsivity combines with depressive

	Abstract = {Intertemporal and probabilistic decision-making has been studied in
	psychiatry, ecology, and neuroeconomics. Because drug addicts and
	psycopaths often make risky decisions (e.g., drug misuse and aggression),
	investigation into types of impulsivity in intertemporal and probabilistic
	choices (delay and probability discounting) are important for psychiatric
	treatments. Studies in behavioral ecology proposed that delay and
	probability discounting are mediated by the same psychological process,
	because a decrease in probability of winning corresponds to an increase
	in delay until winning. According to this view, odds-against winning
	(=1/p-1) in probabilistic choice corresponds to delay in intertemporal
	choice. This hypothesis predicts that preference of gambling (low
	degree of probability discounting) may be associated with patience,
	rather than impulsivity or impatience, in intertemporal choice (low
	degree of delay discounting). However, recent empirical evidence
	in psychiatric research employing pathological gamblers indicates
	that pathological gamblers are impulsive in intertemporal choice
	(high degrees of delay discounting). However, a hyperbolic discounting
	function (usually adopted to explain intertemporal choice) with odds-against
	(instead of delay) explain experimental data in probabilistic choice
	dramatically well. Therefore, an alternative explanation is required
	for the hypothetical equivalence of odds-against to delay. We propose
	that queuing theory (often adopted for analyzing computer network
	traffic) under a competitive social foraging condition may explain
	the equivalence. Our hypothesis may help understand impulsivity of
	psychiatrics in social behavior (e.g., aggression and antisocial
	behavior) in addition to non-social impulsivity in reward-seeking
	(e.g., substance misuse).},

	in delay until winning. According to this view, odds-against winning
	(=1/p-1) in probabilistic choice corresponds to delay in intertemporal
	choice. This hypothesis predicts that preference of gambling (low
	degree of probability discounting) may be associated with patience,
	rather than impulsivity or impatience, in intertemporal choice (low
	degree of delay discounting). However, recent empirical evidence
	in psychiatric research employing pathological gamblers indicates
	that pathological gamblers are impulsive in intertemporal choice
	(high degrees of delay discounting). However, a hyperbolic discounting
	function (usually adopted to explain intertemporal choice) with odds-against
	(instead of delay) explain experimental data in probabilistic choice
	dramatically well. Therefore, an alternative explanation is required
	for the hypothetical equivalence of odds-against to delay. We propose
	that queuing theory (often adopted for analyzing computer network
	traffic) under a competitive social foraging condition may explain
	the equivalence. Our hypothesis may help understand impulsivity of
	psychiatrics in social behavior (e.g., aggression and antisocial
	behavior) in addition to non-social impulsivity in reward-seeking
	(e.g., substance misuse).},

	choice model was used to assess whether emotional valence impacts
	memory sensitivity or response bias. Results revealed that the emotional
	enhancement effect in both age groups was due to a more liberal response

@article{Thapar2001,
	Abstract = {In recent years, Ratcliff, McKoon, and colleagues have argued that
	priming in perceptual implicit memory tests is the result of biases
	in information processing. Three experiments are presented that extend
	this framework to the conceptual implicit memory domain. Participants
	studied a list of words before receiving a set of general knowledge
	questions. For some questions, participants studied the correct answer;
	for others, they studied a similar but incorrect answer. Although
	study of a correct answer facilitated performance, study of the similar
	alternative hurt performance. Costs and benefits of previous study
	were observed in both production and forced-choice tasks. However,
	there was no benefit of previous study when participants studied
	both the correct answer and the similar but incorrect alternative.
	The pattern of results indicates that participants were biased to
	respond with previously studied words on the conceptual implicit
	memory test. This pattern is concordant with the biased information-processing
	approach to priming.},

	Abstract = {There is a longstanding association between substance-use disorders
	(SUDs) and the psychological construct of impulsivity. In the first
	section of this review, personality and neurocognitive data pertaining
	to impulsivity will be summarised in regular users of four classes
	of substance: stimulants, opiates, alcohol and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
	(MDMA). Impulsivity in these groups may arise via two alternative
	mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive. By one account, impulsivity
	may occur as a consequence of chronic exposure to substances causing
	harmful effects on the brain. By the alternative account, impulsivity
	pre-dates SUDs and is associated with the vulnerability to addiction.
	We will review the evidence that impulsivity is associated with addiction
	vulnerability by considering three lines of evidence: (i) studies
	of groups at high-risk for development of SUDs; (ii) studies of pathological
	gamblers, where the harmful consequences of the addiction on brain
	structure are minimised, and (iii) genetic association studies linking
	impulsivity to genetic risk factors for addiction. Within each of
	these three lines of enquiry, there is accumulating evidence that
	impulsivity is a pre-existing vulnerability marker for SUDs.},

@article{Verhoeven1981,
	Abstract = {Since 1975, different morphinomimetic peptides have been isolated
	from hypophyseal-hypothalamic extracts: the pentapeptides methionine-enkephalin
	and leucine-enkephalin, and the longer peptides alpha-, beta- and
	gamma-endorphin. The primary structure of most of these peptides
	is also present in that of beta-lipotropin. The morphinomimetic properties
	of endorphins can be blocked with opiate-antagonists. In rats, moreover,
	the endorphins influence behavior which cannot be blocked with opiate
	antagonists. On the basis of the hypothesis that hyperactivity of
	endorphin systems may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia
	and manic syndromes, the effect of opiate antagonists on psychotic
	and manic symptoms has been examined in a number of clinical studies
	in the past few years. A transient therapeutic effect has been demonstrated
	in about 30\% of the patients so treated. Our own double-blind controlled
	study of 5 schizophrenic and 5 manic patients in the context of a
	World Health Organization project failed to reveal any therapeutic
	effect after subcutaneous injection of 20 mg naloxone. The possible
	reasons of the negative results are discussed.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated changes in brain function associated
	with cocaine dependence and withdrawal to provide clues regarding
	the processes that lead to the uncontrollable self-administration
	of cocaine. METHOD: They measured regional brain metabolism with
	[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography in
	15 outpatients with the diagnosis of cocaine abuse and 17 normal
	comparison subjects. Ten of the patients were studied less than 1
	week after they had last had cocaine, and five were studied 2-4 weeks
	after withdrawal. RESULTS: Patients studied within 1 week of cocaine
	withdrawal but not those studied within 2-4 weeks of cocaine withdrawal
	had higher levels of global brain metabolism as well as higher levels
	of regional brain metabolism in the basal ganglia and orbitofrontal
	cortex than did normal subjects, probably as a consequence of less
	brain dopamine activity. There was also a significant relationship
	between the number of days since cocaine withdrawal and regional
	brain glucose metabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex and in the basal
	ganglia, and the correlations between cocaine craving and metabolic
	activity were significant in the prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal
	cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Although the time-dependent fall in metabolic
	activity suggests that the higher metabolic activity observed less
	than a week after cocaine withdrawal may represent a nonspecific
	expression of drug withdrawal, the selectivity of changes in glucose
	metabolism for the basal ganglia and for the orbitofrontal cortex
	suggests that the regional metabolic changes seen in cocaine abusers
	during detoxification are related to changes in brain dopamine activity.},

	of 13 normal social drinkers under baseline conditions and after
	acute alcohol intoxication. Blood flow measurements were done using
	15O-labeled water and positron emission tomography (PET). Each subject
	underwent two control sessions under baseline conditions and two
	sessions after alcohol. Seven of the subjects were given 0.5 g/kg
	of alcohol and six were given 1 g/kg of alcohol p.o. The first and
	second post-alcohol scans were done 40 and 60 min after alcohol ingestion.
	The studies revealed that both the high and the low doses of alcohol
	reduced blood flow to the cerebellum. This effect was significant
	only for the high doses of alcohol, which also increased blood flow
	to the right temporal and the prefrontal cortex. The decrease in
	blood flow of the cerebellum could account for the muscular incoordination
	induced by alcohol.},

	Abstract = {The focal point of this paper is the transition from drug use to drug
	dependence. We present new evidence on risk for starting to use marijuana,
	cocaine, and alcohol, as well as risks for progression from first
	drug use to the onset of drug dependence, separately for each of
	these drugs. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) were
	analyzed. The NCS had a representative sample of the United States
	population ages 15-54 years (n = 8,098). Survival analysis techniques
	were used to provide age- and time-specific risk estimates of initiating
	use of marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol, as well as of becoming dependent
	on each drug. With respect to risk of initiating use, estimated peak
	values for alcohol and marijuana were found at age 18, about two
	years earlier than the later peak in risk of initiating cocaine use.
	With respect to risk of meeting criteria for the clinical dependence
	syndrome, estimated peak values for alcohol and marijuana were found
	at age 17-18. Peak values for cocaine dependence were found at age
	23-25. Once use began, cocaine dependence emerged early and more
	explosively, with an estimated 5-6\% of cocaine users becoming cocaine
	dependent in the first year of use. Most of the observed cases of
	cocaine dependence met criteria for dependence within three years
	after initial cocaine use. Whereas some 15-16\% of cocaine users
	had developed cocaine dependence within 10 years of first cocaine
	use, the corresponding values were about 8\% for marijuana users,
	and 12-13\% for alcohol users. The most novel findings of this study
	document a noteworthy risk for quickly developing cocaine dependence
	after initial cocaine use, with about one in 16 to 20 cocaine users
	becoming dependent within the first year of cocaine use. For marijuana
	and alcohol, there is a more insidious onset of the drug dependence
	syndrome.},

	Abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype has a major influence on the risk
	for Alzheimer disease (AD). Different apoE isoforms may alter AD
	pathogenesis via their interactions with the amyloid beta-peptide
	(Abeta). Mice lacking the lipid transporter ABCA1 were found to have
	markedly decreased levels and lipidation of apoE in the central nervous
	system. We hypothesized that if Abca1-/- mice were bred to the PDAPP
	mouse model of AD, PDAPP Abca1-/ mice would have a phenotype similar
	to that of PDAPP Apoe+/- and PDAPP Apoe-/- mice, which develop less
	amyloid deposition than PDAPP Apoe+/+ mice. In contrast to this prediction,
	12-month-old PDAPP Abca -/- mice had significantly higher levels
	of hippocampal Abeta, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy was significantly
	more common compared with PDAPP Abca1+/+ mice. Amyloid precursor
	protein (APP) C-terminal fragments were not different between Abca1
	genotypes prior to plaque deposition in 3-month-old PDAPP mice, suggesting
	that deletion of Abca1 did not affect APP processing or Abeta production.
	As expected, 3-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had decreased apoE levels,
	but they also had a higher percentage of carbonate-insoluble apoE,
	suggesting that poorly lipidated apoE is less soluble in vivo. We
	also found that 12-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had a higher percentage
	of carbonate-insoluble apoE and that apoE deposits co-localize with
	amyloid plaques, demonstrating that poorly lipidated apoE co-deposits
	with insoluble Abeta. Together, these data suggest that despite substantially
	lower apoE levels, poorly lipidated apoE produced in the absence
	of ABCA1 is strongly amyloidogenic in vivo.},

	Abstract = {APOE genotype is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer
	disease (AD). ABCA1, a member of the ATP-binding cassette family
	of active transporters, lipidates apoE in the CNS. Abca1(-/-) mice
	have decreased lipid associated with apoE and increased amyloid deposition
	in several AD mouse models. We hypothesized that mice overexpressing
	ABCA1 in the brain would have increased lipidation of apoE-containing
	lipoproteins and decreased amyloid deposition. To address these hypotheses,
	we created PrP-mAbca1 Tg mice that overexpress mouse Abca1 throughout
	the brain under the control of the mouse prion promoter. We bred
	the PrP-mAbca1 mice to the PDAPP AD mouse model, a transgenic line
	overexpressing a mutant human amyloid precursor protein. PDAPP/Abca1
	Tg mice developed a phenotype remarkably similar to that seen in
	PDAPP/Apoe(-/-) mice: there was significantly less amyloid beta-peptide
	(Abeta) deposition, a redistribution of Abeta to the hilus of the
	dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, and an almost complete absence
	of thioflavine S-positive amyloid plaques. Analyses of CSF from PrP-mAbca1
	Tg mice and media conditioned by PrP-mAbca1 Tg primary astrocytes
	demonstrated increased lipidation of apoE-containing particles. These
	data support the conclusions that increased ABCA1-mediated lipidation

	Abstract = {Our ability to judge the consequences of our actions is central to
	rational decision making. A large body of evidence implicates primate
	prefrontal regions in the regulation of this ability. It has proven
	extremely difficult, however, to separate functional areas in the
	frontal lobes. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate
	complementary and reciprocal roles for the human orbitofrontal (OFC)
	and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices (ACd) in monitoring the outcome
	of behavior. Activation levels in these regions were negatively correlated,
	with activation increasing in the ACd and decreasing in the OFC when
	the selected response was the result of the participant's own decision.
	The pattern was reversed when the selected response was guided by
	the experimenter rather than the participant. These results indicate
	that the neural mechanisms underlying the way we assess the consequences
	of choices differ depending on whether we are told what to do or
	are able to exercise our volition.},

	Abstract = {Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens may be an
	important factor in ethanol reinforcement and genetically determined
	ethanol preference. This hypothesis was tested by measuring dopamine
	(DA) release by intracranial microdialysis during voluntary oral
	ethanol self-administration in alcohol-preferring (P) and genetically
	heterogeneous Wistar rats. The animals were trained to respond for
	ethanol (10\% w/v) or water in a free-choice operant task. Extracellular
	DA levels in the nucleus accumbens were subsequently monitored during
	30-min self-administration sessions and a 15-min "waiting period"
	before session onset. Ethanol self-administration in all animals
	was followed by a significant, dose-dependent rise in DA release
	with maximal effects at approximately 15 min after peak intake. Dose-effect
	functions revealed significantly steeper slopes for the DA-releasing

	rats. Over an identical range of ethanol doses and blood alcohol
	levels, increases in DA efflux ranged from 143\% to 459\% of basal
	levels in P rats but only from 142\% to 212\% in Wistar rats. To
	differentiate the pharmacological effects of ethanol from the effects
	of operant responding, additional groups of P and Wistar rats were
	tested during self-administration of saccharin (0.05\% w/v). By contrast
	with ethanol, saccharin did not substantially elevate extracellular
	DA levels. A significant, transient increase in DA efflux was, however,
	observed in both strains of rats during the presession waiting period
	in the absence of ethanol or saccharin availability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rates and patterns of major depression
	and bipolar disorder based on cross-national epidemiologic surveys.
	DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based epidemiologic studies using
	similar methods from 10 countries: the United States, Canada, Puerto
	Rico, France, West Germany, Italy, Lebanon, Taiwan, Korea, and New
	Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 38000 community subjects. OUTCOME
	MEASURES: Rates, demographics, and age at onset of major depression
	and bipolar disorder. Symptom profiles, comorbidity, and marital
	status with major depression. RESULTS: The lifetime rates for major
	depression vary widely across countries, ranging from 1.5 cases per
	100 adults in the sample in Taiwan to 19.0 cases per 100 adults in
	Beirut. The annual rates ranged from 0.8 cases per 100 adults in
	Taiwan to 5.8 cases per 100 adults in New Zealand. The mean age at
	onset shows less variation (range, 24.8-34.8 years). In every country,
	the rates of major depression were higher for women than men. By
	contrast, the lifetime rates of bipolar disorder are more consistent
	across countries (0.3/100 in Taiwan to 1.5/100 in New Zealand); the
	sex ratios are nearly equal; and the age at first onset is earlier
	(average, 6 years) than the onset of major depression. Insomnia and
	loss of energy occurred in most persons with major depression at
	each site. Persons with major depression were also at increased risk
	for comorbidity with substance abuse and anxiety disorders at all
	sites. Persons who were separated or divorced had significantly higher
	rates of major depression than married persons in most of the countries,
	and the risk was somewhat greater for divorced or separated men than
	women in most countries. CONCLUSIONS: There are striking similarities
	across countries in patterns of major depression and of bipolar disorder.
	The differences in rates for major depression across countries suggest
	that cultural differences or different risk factors affect the expression
	of the disorder.},

	Abstract = {Do decisions about potential gains and potential losses require different
	neural structures for advantageous choices? In a lesion study, we
	used a new measure of adaptive decision making under risk to examine
	whether damage to neural structures subserving emotion affects an
	individual's ability to make adaptive decisions differentially for
	gains and losses. We found that individuals with lesions to the amygdala,
	an area responsible for processing emotional responses, displayed
	impaired decision making when considering potential gains, but not
	when considering potential losses. In contrast, patients with damage
	to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area responsible for integrating
	cognitive and emotional information, showed deficits in both domains.
	We argue that this dissociation provides evidence that adaptive decision
	making for risks involving potential losses may be more difficult
	to disrupt than adaptive decision making for risks involving potential
	gains. This research further demonstrates the role of emotion in
	decision competence.},

	from early childhood to adolescence and their effects on early onset
	of substance use were examined. Behavioral control is the tendency
	to express or contain one's impulses and behaviors. Resiliency is
	the ability to adapt flexibly one's characteristic level of control
	in response to the environment. Study participants were 514 children
	of alcoholics and matched controls from a longitudinal community
	sample (Time 1 age in years: M=4.32, SD=0.89). Children with slower
	rates of increase in behavioral control were more likely to use alcohol
	and other drugs in adolescence. Children with higher initial levels
	of resiliency were less likely to begin using alcohol.},

	Abstract = {Making optimal decisions in the face of uncertain or incomplete information
	arises as a common problem in everyday behavior, but the neural processes
	underlying this ability remain poorly understood. A typical case
	is navigation, in which a subject has to search for a known goal
	from an unknown location. Navigating under uncertain conditions requires
	making decisions on the basis of the current belief about location
	and updating that belief based on incoming information. Here, we
	use functional magnetic resonance imaging during a maze navigation
	task to study neural activity relating to the resolution of uncertainty
	as subjects make sequential decisions to reach a goal. We show that
	distinct regions of prefrontal cortex are engaged in specific computational
	functions that are well described by a Bayesian model of decision
	making. This permits efficient goal-oriented navigation and provides
	new insights into decision making by humans.},
