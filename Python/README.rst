hBayesDM
========

This is the Python version of *hBayesDM* (hierarchical Bayesian modeling of
Decision-Making tasks), a user-friendly package that offers hierarchical
Bayesian analysis of various computational models on an array of
decision-making tasks. *hBayesDM* in Python uses `PyStan`_ (Python interface for
`Stan`_) for Bayesian inference.

It supports Python 3.5 or higher versions and requires several packages including:
`NumPy`_, `SciPy`_, `Pandas`_, `PyStan`_, `Matplotlib`_, and `ArviZ`_.
