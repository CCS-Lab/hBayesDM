**hBayesDM** (hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks) is a user-friendly R package that offers hierarchical Bayesian analysis of various computational models on an array of decision-making tasks. hBayesDM uses [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) for Bayesian inference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

To install hBayesDM, **[RStan][rstan] should be properly installed before you proceed**.
For detailed instructions, please go to this link:
https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

[rstan]: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan

For the moment, RStan requires you to specify that the C++14 standard should be used to compile Stan programs (based on [this link][rstan-loading]):
```r
Sys.setenv(USE_CXX14 = 1)
library("rstan") # observe startup messages
```

### Installation

hBayesDM can be installed from CRAN by running the following command in R:

```r
install.packages('hBayesDM')  # Install hBayesDM from CRAN
```

**We strongly recommend users to install hBayesDM from GitHub**. All models in this GitHub version are precompiled, which saves time for compiling Stan models. However, it may cause some memory allocation issues on a Windows machine.

You can install the latest version from GitHub with:

```r
# `devtools` is required to install hBayesDM from GitHub
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CCS-Lab/hBayesDM")
```
