**hBayesDM** (hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks) is a user-friendly R package that offers hierarchical Bayesian analysis of various computational models on an array of decision-making tasks. hBayesDM uses [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) for Bayesian inference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

To install hBayesDM, **[RStan][rstan] should be properly installed before you proceed**.
For detailed instructions, please go to this link:
https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

[rstan]: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan

### Installation

hBayesDM can be installed from CRAN by running the following command in R:

```r
install.packages("hBayesDM")  # Install hBayesDM from CRAN
```

or you can also install via GitHub with:

```r
# `devtools` is required to install hBayesDM from GitHub
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("CCS-Lab/hBayesDM")
```

#### Building at once

In default, you should build a Stan file into a binary for the first time to use the
model, so it can be quite bothersome.
In order to build all the models at once, you should set an environmental variable
`BUILD_ALL` to `true`.
We highly recommend you to use multiple cores for build, since it requires quite
a long time to complete.

```r
Sys.setenv(BUILD_ALL='true')  # Build all the models on installation
Sys.setenv(MAKEFLAGS='-j 4')  # Use 4 cores for compilation (or the number you want)

install.packages("hBayesDM")  # Install from CRAN
# or
devtools::install_github("CCS-Lab/hBayesDM")  # Install from GitHub
```

### Caveats

Before you load `hBayesDM`, you should load `rstan` to make sampling properly work.

```r
library(rstan)
library(hBayesDM)
```
