**hBayesDM** (hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks) is a user-friendly package that offers hierarchical Bayesian analysis of various computational models on an array of decision-making tasks. hBayesDM uses [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) for Bayesian inference.

Now, **hBayesDM** supports both [R](./R) and [Python](./Python)!
