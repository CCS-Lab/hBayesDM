\arguments{
\item{task_name}{Character value for name of task. E.g. \code{"gng"}.}

\item{model_name}{Character value for name of model. E.g. \code{"m1"}.}

\item{model_type}{Character value for modeling type: \code{""} OR \code{"single"} OR
\code{"multipleB"}.}

\item{data_columns}{Character vector of necessary column names for the data. E.g.
\code{c("subjID", "cue", "keyPressed", "outcome")}.}

\item{parameters}{List of parameters, with information about their lower bound, plausible value,
upper bound. E.g. \code{list("xi" = c(0, 0.1, 1), "ep" = c(0, 0.2, 1), "rho" = c(0, exp(2),
Inf))}.}

\item{regressors}{List of regressors, with information about their extracted dimensions. E.g.
\code{list("Qgo" = 2, "Qnogo" = 2, "Wgo" = 2, "Wnogo" = 2)}. OR if model-based regressors are
not available for this model, \code{NULL}.}

\item{postpreds}{Character vector of name(s) for the trial-level posterior predictive
simulations. Default is \code{"y_pred"}. OR if posterior predictions are not yet available for
this model, \code{NULL}.}

\item{stanmodel_arg}{Leave as \code{NULL} (default) for completed models. Else should either be a
character value (specifying the name of a Stan file) OR a \code{stanmodel} object (returned as
a result of running \code{\link[rstan]{stan_model}}).}

\item{preprocess_func}{Function to preprocess the raw data before it gets passed to Stan. Takes
(at least) two arguments: a data.table object \code{raw_data} and a list object
\code{general_info}. Possible to include additional argument(s) to use during preprocessing.
Should return a list object \code{data_list}, which will then directly be passed to Stan.}

\details{
\strong{task_name}: Typically same task models share the same data column requirements.

\strong{model_name}: Typically different models are distinguished by their different list of
  parameters.

\strong{model_type} is one of the following three:
\describe{
  \item{\code{""}}{Modeling of multiple subjects. (Default hierarchical Bayesian analysis.)}
  \item{\code{"single"}}{Modeling of a single subject.}
  \item{\code{"multipleB"}}{Modeling of multiple subjects, where multiple blocks exist within
    each subject.}
}

\strong{data_columns} must be the entirety of necessary data columns used at some point in the R
  or Stan code. I.e. \code{"subjID"} must always be included. In the case of 'multipleB' type
  models, \code{"block"} should also be included as well.

\strong{parameters} is a list object, whose keys are the parameters of this model. Each parameter
  key must be assigned a numeric vector holding 3 elements: the parameter's lower bound,
  plausible value, and upper bound.

\strong{regressors} is a list object, whose keys are the model-based regressors of this model.
  Each regressor key must be assigned a numeric value indicating the number of dimensions its
  data will be extracted as. If model-based regressors are not available for this model, this
  argument should just be \code{NULL}.

\strong{postpreds} defaults to \code{"y_pred"}, but any other character vector holding
  appropriate names is possible (c.f. Two-Step Task models). If posterior predictions are not yet
  available for this model, this argument should just be \code{NULL}.

\strong{stanmodel_arg} can be used by developers, during the developmental stage of creating a
  new model function. If this argument is passed a character value, the Stan file with the
  corresponding name will be used for model fitting. If this argument is passed a
  \code{stanmodel} object, that \code{stanmodel} object will be used for model fitting. When
  creation of the model function is complete, this argument should just be left as \code{NULL}.

\strong{preprocess_func} is the part of the code that is specific to the model, and is thus
  written in the specific model R file.\cr
Arguments for this function are:
\describe{
  \item{\code{raw_data}}{A data.table that holds the raw user data, which was read by using
    \code{\link[data.table]{fread}}.}
  \item{\code{general_info}}{A list that holds the general informations about the raw data, i.e.
    \code{subjs}, \code{n_subj}, \code{t_subjs}, \code{t_max}, \code{b_subjs}, \code{b_max}.}
  \item{\code{...}}{Optional additional argument(s) that specific model functions may want to
    include. Examples of such additional arguments currently being used in hBayesDM models are:
    \code{RTbound} (choiceRT_ddm models), \code{payscale} (igt models), and \code{trans_prob} (ts
    models).}
}
Return value for this function should be:
\describe{
  \item{\code{data_list}}{A list with appropriately named keys (as required by the model Stan
    file), holding the fully preprocessed user data.}
}
NOTE: Syntax for data.table slightly differs from that of data.frame. If you want to use
  \code{raw_data} as a data.frame when writing the \code{preprocess_func}, simply begin with the
  line: \code{raw_data <- as.data.frame(raw_data)}.\cr
NOTE: Because of allowing case & underscore insensitive column names in user data,
  \code{raw_data} columns must now be referenced by their lowercase non-underscored versions,
  e.g. \code{"subjid"}, within the code of the preprocess function.\cr
